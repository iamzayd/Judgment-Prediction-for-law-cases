thousand and twelve at approximately nine am the applicant who had been placed in pretrial detention in Budapest Prison was transported to the premises of the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning He was accompanied by two guards and was handed over for questioning at around ninetwenty am when he showed no sign of injuries\\n\\nsix  The questioning started at approximately ninefiftyfive am and lasted until approximately eleventhirty am It was conducted by police officers A and B The applicant chose not to give a statement\\n\\nseven  On being released after the interrogation the applicant was handed over to the guards of Budapest Prison who in the presence of the police officer asked him whether he had been illtreated The applicant declared that he had not been\\n\\neight  After being transported back to Budapest Prison the applicant underwent a medical examination before his readmission during which he claimed that he had been illtreated by police officer A Certain injuries were noted on the applicant A report was drawn up on the incident and photos were taken of the injuries\\n\\nnine  Right after the medical examination the applicant was again transported to the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning from where he was taken to the military hospital by the police officer conducting his interrogation and allegedly assaulting him At the hospital he was examined in the presence of the police officer The medical report noted bleeding on the lower lip jaw sensitive to pressure and bruises on the ribs all likely to heal within eight days\\n\\nten  According to the applicants submission following his return to Budapest Prison he was again subjected to a medical examination\\n\\neleven  The police report filed by A on nineteen July two thousand and twelve stated that the applicant had not been illtreated during questioning None of the police officers had seen the applicant harming himself but A had observed him biting his nails and lips Also according to the report the applicant had been left alone for a few minutes at the police station without constant surveillance\\n\\ntwelve  On twenty July two thousand and twelve the applicant complained of a headache and dizziness and was again examined by medical staff at Budapest Prison He asserted that he had been illtreated during his interrogation The medical report recorded the following injuries swelling on the right cheek head sensitive to pressure bruising on the lower lip and abrasions on the lower right ribs and on the left shoulder blade\\n\\nthirteen  Budapest Prison initiated criminal proceedings on charges of forced interrogation Furthermore the applicants statements given during the medical examination see paragraph eight above were qualified as a criminal complaint by the investigation authorities\\n\\nfourteen  In the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the Central Investigation Office the applicant gave a testimony on fourteen November two thousand and twelve stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head neck and back He had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up he had been slapped four or five times in the face He had been shown the results of a DNA test and when he refused to comment on it had again been beaten by the police officer The same police officer had also punched him in the mouth when he had failed to recognise a person shown to him in a photograph He had been pushed against the door and when he again fell over the police officer had kicked him on his left side\\n\\nfifteen  On twentyfour July two thousand and thirteen one of the prisoner escort officers C was questioned and recalled that the applicant had complained of illtreatment upon his return to the prison facility which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicants body He also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicants face following the medical examination at Budapest Prison He had asked the applicant why he had not complained of his illtreatment earlier to which the applicant had replied that he had been afraid of the police officers According to C as a general practice detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselves\\n\\nsixteen  On twentyfive July two thousand and thirteen D the other prisoner escort officer who accompanied the applicant to his interrogation was also heard as a witness He did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer He had a vague recollection that since there had been some complaints from the applicants side once they had arrived back at the prison facility they had had to transfer him back to the police department He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicants face following interrogation they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been illtreated by the police officers Therefore in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogation\\n\\nseventeen  On six October two thousand and thirteen E the prison security officer who had taken photos of the applicants injuries during his readmission was questioned as a witness He could not give any details of the incident He could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination but suggested that the applicants injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff which was why he had been called on to take photos\\n\\neighteen  On eighteen November two thousand and thirteen F the nurse on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned but she did not remember the incident She could only confirm that if she had seen the applicants injuries prior to his transfer she would surely have inquired about their origin Examining the photos of the applicant she asserted that the bruises on the applicants face would have occurred immediately after an impact and that the applicant could have caused them himself\\n\\nnineteen  On five December two thousand and thirteen G the guard on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned as a witness he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint He nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo he would surely have inquired about their origin\\n\\ntwenty  On two January two thousand and fourteen the Central Investigation Office also heard evidence from H and I two prison escort officers from Budapest Prison who had been on duty on the day of the incident and who were responsible for transferring detainees to the healthcare facilities They did not remember the applicant and could not recall the circumstances of his medical examination or admission to the prison since as one of them explained they were responsible for escorting thirty to forty prisoners a day H stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations whereas I asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in socalled healthcare waiting rooms Neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicant\\n\\ntwentyone  On the same day three members of the medical staff of Budapest Prison were also heard as witnesses Two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases Another member of the healthcare staff stated that she had a recollection of an incident but was not sure whether it involved the applicant or another person As a general rule the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries Examining the photos of the applicant two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos they werent even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicants face while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was taken\\n\\ntwentytwo  The prison doctor was also questioned the same day She could not identify the applicant did not remember whether she had met him had no recollection of the incident and could only recount what she had previously stated in the medical report However she stated that if the applicant had been left alone he could have inflicted the injuries on himself\\n\\ntwentythree  The Central Investigation Office commissioned a forensic expert opinion According to the expert assessment the applicants account of the origins of his injuries was implausible since if he had been illtreated in the way described by him his injuries would have been of a more serious nature Furthermore the location of the injuries had not corresponded to the applicants description of the incident either The report stated that it was impossible to establish when the applicants injuries had occurred Referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himself\\n\\ntwentyfour  The investigation was discontinued on eight May two thousand and fourteen on the grounds that the applicants allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion According to the reasoning the available evidence neither refuted nor proved the applicants allegations The applicant complained seeking the continuation of the investigations The firstinstance decision was upheld by the Chief Prosecutors Office on fifteen July two thousand and fourteen The decision called the applicants attention to the possibility of lodging of initiating substitute private prosecution proceedings\\n\\nII  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\\n\\ntwentyfive  The relevant domestic law is set out in Borbála Kiss v Hungary no fiftynine thousand two hundred and fourteeneleven  seventeen twentysix June two thousand and twelve\\n\\n</td>\n",
       "      <td>\\n\\nI  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION\\n\\ntwentysix  The applicant complained that he had been illtreated by the police and that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the illtreatment in breach of Article three of the Convention which provides\\n\\nNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\n\\nA  Admissibility\\n\\none  The parties submissions\\n\\na  The Government\\n\\ntwentyseven  The Government first objected that the application was inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies They submitted that the applicant should have pursued substitute private prosecution proceedings which could have remedied the alleged violation of the States procedural obligations  and in particular the obligation incumbent on the prosecution authorities to take the necessary steps to establish the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators They added that if the applicants motion for private prosecution proceedings had been dismissed by the firstinstance court he could have either appealed against this decision or lodged a constitutional complaint\\n\\ntwentyeight  The Government also submitted that the Courts findings in Borbála Kiss v Hungary cited above  twentyfivetwentysix and Gubacsi v Hungary no fortyfour thousand six hundred and eightysixseven  thirtyonethirtytwo twentyeight June two thousand and eleven were not applicable in the present case since in those cases the reason for dismissing the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies had been the apparent legal uncertainty concerning substitute private prosecution proceedings The Government further suggested that the Court should take the same approach as it had in the case of Horváth and Vadászi v Hungary dec no two thousand three hundred and fiftyonesix nine November two thousand and ten which was declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies\\n\\ntwentynine  The Government also argued that the admittedly low success rate of substitute private prosecution proceedings did not mean that this procedure was inefficient since the dismissal of such applications was mainly due to noncompliance with the relevant formal requirements\\n\\nb  The applicant\\n\\nthirty  The applicant for his part submitted that the Government had not produced any evidence to show that substitute private prosecution proceedings had been an effective remedy in cases similar to his and would therefore constitute a remedy to be exhausted in the circumstances He argued that he had sought redress through the available national channels by lodging a criminal complaint The mere fact that his attention had been drawn to the possibility of acting as a substitute private prosecutor had not in itself rendered this legal avenue an effective remedy to be exhausted He lodged a criminal complaint by which the responsibility to pursue the prosecution of officers accused of illtreatment lay with the public prosecutor and there was no reason to require him to have pursued the prosecution of the accused officers of his own motion\\n\\ntwo  The Courts assessment\\n\\nthirtyone  The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for alleged breaches alleged to have taken place see Pyrantienė v Lithuania no fortyfive thousand and ninetytwoseven  twentysix twelve November two thousand and thirteen An applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried other remedies that were available but probably no more likely to be successful see Hristovi v Bulgaria no fortytwo thousand six hundred and ninetysevenfive  fiftytwo eleven October two thousand and eleven and the cases cited therein\\n\\nthirtytwo  The Court notes that in the present case during his first medical examination the applicant declared that he had been illtreated by the police see paragraph eight above His statements were qualified as criminal complaints by the investigating authorities see paragraph thirteen above Subsequently a criminal investigation was opened against unknown perpetrators for illtreatment in the course of official proceedings Following the firstinstance decision discontinuing proceedings the applicant lodged a complaint seeking continuation of the investigations see paragraph twentyfour above There is nothing to indicate that the ensuing proceedings would not in principle have been capable of leading to the identification and if appropriate punishment of those responsible\\n\\nthirtythree  In the Courts view by virtue of that remedy the State had been afforded an opportunity to put matters right The applicant must therefore be regarded as having brought the substance of his complaint to the notice of the national authorities and as having sought redress for his complaint through the domestic channels He was thus not required additionally to pursue the matter by instituting substitute private prosecution proceedings which would have had the same objective as his appeal against the discontinuation of the investigation see for similar reasoning RB v Hungary no sixtyfour thousand six hundred and twotwelve  sixtytwo twelve April two thousand and sixteen\\n\\nthirtyfour  In particular the Court cannot subscribe to the Governments view see paragraph twentyeight above that in the cases of Borbála Kiss and Gubacsi both cited above the applicants were not required to pursue private prosecution proceedings only because of the uncertainty prevailing at that time concerning the effectiveness of that legal avenue Indeed an additional important consideration was the fact that the applicants had already lodged a criminal complaint concerning the alleged illtreatment so that that they could not be expected to have lodged a second virtually identical complaint mentioning particular individuals by name see Borbála Kiss cited above  twentysix and Gubacsi cited above  thirtytwo As to the Governments reference to the Horváth and Vadászi decision cited above the Court considers that the related conclusions reached in that case are not applicable to the present circumstances since in that case the Court found that the applicants had not raised the essence of their claim  which was racial discrimination  in their private bill of indictment which was concerned with endangering minors\\n\\nthirtyfive  It follows that the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed Furthermore the Court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissible\\n\\nB  Merits\\n\\none  The parties submissions\\n\\na  The applicant\\n\\nthirtysix  The applicant maintained that he had suffered physical illtreatment during his interrogation He further submitted that he could not have inflicted the injuries on himself since he had been held in a waist restraint belt during his transportation in the special vehicle and had otherwise been held under constant supervision He argued that the investigating authorities should have obtained evidence in this respect Furthermore the domestic authorities had no basis for arriving at the conclusion that his injuries had been caused by his own conduct He also submitted that in line with the procedural rules concerning readmission to prison he had undergone a medical checkup for a third time on nineteen July two thousand and twelve see paragraph ten above but the report drawn up during this examination had not formed part of the investigation carried out by the domestic authorities\\n\\nthirtyseven  The applicant emphasised that in line with the Courts caselaw the burden of proof rested on the Government to show how and when the injuries of an individual taken into police custody in good health but found to be injured at the time of release had been sustained The Government however had failed plausibly to explain how when and where the injuries had occurred if not at the police station He questioned the authority of the witness testimonies which had been taken more than a year after the incident concerning the origin of his injuries\\n\\nthirtyeight  The applicant further submitted that the investigation into his allegations had not been adequate for the purpose of Article three Most importantly the investigating authorities had not obtained evidence from the witnesses in due time and the investigation file had not contained all the medical documentation which could have substantiated his allegation of illtreatment They had also failed to question the police officer besides A who had been present for a brief period during the applicants interrogation Moreover the domestic authorities had based their finding solely on the forensic medical expert opinion which had not provided a plausible explanation for the cause of the injuries and had not taken any further investigative steps\\n\\nb  The Government\\n\\nthirtynine  The Government submitted that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been illtreated by the police officer First they highlighted the contradictions between the applicants account of events  namely that he had been beaten for several minutes with great force  and the findings of the forensic expert opinion according to which the applicants injuries had been of a minor severity Furthermore according to the prosecutors office the applicant had not been constantly monitored thus he could have inflicted the injuries on himself In this respect the Government also emphasised that there was no evidence that the applicant had been restrained during his transportation and the witness testimonies had not shed light on this question either Moreover the applicant had only complained of illtreatment following his transfer back to Budapest Prison and not immediately after his handover from the police to the prison escort officers The Government lastly pointed to the witness testimony of one of the medical staff who had commented when examining the photograph of the applicant that she could not be certain whether he actually had an injury on his face or merely pronounced cheekbones see paragraph twentyone above\\n\\ntwo  The Courts assessment\\n\\na  Concerning the alleged illtreatment\\n\\nforty  As the Court has stated on many occasions Article three of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment irrespective of the circumstances or the conduct of the person concerned see Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine  eightyone ECHR two thousand and fifteen with further references Illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article three The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case such as the duration of the treatment its physical or mental effects and in some cases the sex age and state of health of the victim see Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and fiftynine ECHR two thousand and sixteen extracts\\n\\nfortyone  Allegations of illtreatment contrary to Article three must be supported by appropriate evidence To assess this evidence the Court adopts the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightytwo\\n\\nfortytwo  On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities as in the case of persons within their control in custody strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention The burden of proof then rests with the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw interferences which may be unfavourable for the Government That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightythree\\n\\nfortythree  In the instant case the applicant complained that during his interrogation he was subjected to acts of police brutality The Court notes that medical reports confirmed that the applicant had suffered bleeding on the lower lip bruises on the ribs and sensitivity at his jaw see paragraph nine above The Court considers that in the instant case the injury suffered by the applicant was sufficiently serious to amount to illtreatment within the scope of Article three\\n\\nfortyfour  In the light of the parties submissions the witness testimonies and the relevant medical evidence it is uncontested that the applicants injuries were sustained while under the control of the state authorities either during his questioning at the police station or thereafter when he was being transferred or readmitted to the prison see paragraphs nine and fifteentwentytwo aboveThe disagreement between the parties concerned the exact nature and causes of the applicants injuries\\n\\nfortyfive  The Court observes that the investigation into forced interrogation was discontinued on the grounds that the applicants statements could not be corroborated by any testimony in the absence of eye witnesses during questioning see paragraph twentyfour above Moreover the forensic expert opinion did not confirm the applicants account of the incident stating that the nature of the injuries excluded that they could have been caused by the mechanism described by the applicant That opinion even assumed based on the location of the injuries that they could have been selfinflicted see paragraph twentythree above This conclusion was also supported by the Government in their submissions see paragraph thirtynine above\\n\\nfortysix  It is true that no conclusive evidence is available concerning the time at which the injuries occurred and the other circumstances surrounding the incident In particular the Court finds no elements which could indicate with sufficient certainty that the injuries sustained by the applicant were inflicted by use of force by the police Furthermore there is no evidence in the case file which could call into question the findings of the medical report or could add probative weight to the applicants allegations\\n\\nfortyseven  In the light of the foregoing the Court cannot consider it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was subjected to illtreatment during his time in police custody\\n\\nfortyeight  It follows that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention under its substantive aspect\\n\\nb  Concerning the alleged inadequacy of the investigation\\n\\nfortynine  The Court refers to the general principles set out among other judgments in ElMasri v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia GC no thirtynine thousand six hundred and thirtynine  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive ECHR two thousand and twelve and Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts among other judgments Those principles indicate in particular that the investigation into serious allegations of illtreatment must be both prompt and thorough and authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including inter alia eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard\\n\\nfifty  In the present case the Court finds that the applicants injuries were serious enough see paragraphs nine and fortythree above and that his complaint of illtreatment was arguable for the purposes of Article three thus requiring the domestic authorities to carry out an effective investigation\\n\\nfiftyone  The Court observes that in the present case it was established that the applicant had no injuries before the interrogation and that the key element of consideration for the investigation authorities was whether the applicant could have inflicted the injuries on himself a possibility suggested by the forensic expert opinion see paragraph twentythree above The only viable means for the Central Investigation Office to obtain certainty on this point would have been to hear the testimony of the police officers present during his questioning A and B of the escort officers accompanying the applicant during his transfer in an outside the prison facilities C D E G H and I and of the medical staff who examined the applicant before his readmission F the three members of the medical staff mentioned in paragraph twentyone above and the prison doctor\\n\\nfiftytwo  However the investigating authorities obtained such testimony from the prison escort officers and medical staff only after a certain period of time had lapsed in some cases more than a year after the incident see paragraphs fifteen to twentytwo above At this point most of the witnesses no longer had any recollection whatsoever of the events and could not even recognise the applicant from a photo Even those officers on duty who had been with the applicant for an extended time could not recall the exact details of his transfer This was mainly so according to the witnesses own assessment because they had been responsible for the admission transfer and examination of a large number of detainees on a daily basis making it impossible to distinguish cases after a certain lapse of time The witnesses could therefore only reply to the investigation authorities questions in a general manner or theoretically without an actual link to the present case For the Court the delay in questioning the witnesses significantly tainted the official investigation being pursued by the State authorities which was not redressed by the fact that they were ultimately heard in the course of the investigations\\n\\nfiftythree  On the other hand the Court observes that the names of the persons on duty on the day of the incident must have been easily accessible to the investigation authorities Moreover there is nothing in the case file  and the Government did not provide any elements either  indicating that the investigation authorities had been prevented from questioning the witnesses in due time In the Courts view the prosecutors office made no genuine efforts for a considerable length of time to establish how the applicants injuries could have occurred\\n\\nfiftyfour  The Court further observes that the applicant alleged that he had been illtreated by police officer A However neither he nor B the other police officer present during the questioning according to the police report see paragraphs six and eleven above was questioned during the investigation The unsatisfactory course of action followed by the domestic authorities was unlikely to shed light on the central element of their inquiry namely whether the police officer used force against the applicant during interrogation\\n\\nfiftyfive  Similarly no further measures were taken with a view to resolving the discrepancy between the version of events documented in the police report and the allegations of the applicant A possible investigative measure in this respect could have been to organise a facetoface confrontation see mutatis mutandis Bouyid cited above  one hundred and twentyeight in order to assess the credibility of each sides statements as regards the facts\\n\\nfiftysix  Given the above the Court finds that the authorities did not do all that could have been reasonably expected of them to investigate the incident\\n\\nfiftyseven  Accordingly the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation into the applicants complaint and that there has therefore been a violation of Article three of the Convention in its procedural limb\\n\\nII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTION\\n\\nfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention provides\\n\\nIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party\\n\\nA  Damage\\n\\nfiftynine  The applicant claimed tenzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damage\\n\\nsixty  The Government contested this claim\\n\\nsixtyone  Taking into account all the circumstances of the present case the Court accepts that the applicant has suffered nonpecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation Making its assessment on an equitable basis the Court awards the applicant EUR sixzero in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable\\n\\nB  Costs and expenses\\n\\nsixtytwo  The applicant also claimed EUR sixfour hundred plus VAT for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court This amount corresponded to thirtytwo hours of legal work billable by his lawyer at an hourly rate of EUR two hundred plus VAT\\n\\nsixtythree  The Government contested this claim\\n\\nsixtyfour  According to the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum In the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR twozero for the proceedings before the Court\\n\\nC  Default interest\\n\\nsixtyfive  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points\\n\\n</td>\n",

       "0  \\n\\nI  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE\\n\\nfour  The applicant was born in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven and is detained in Tiszalök\\n\\nfive  On nineteen July two thousand and twelve at approximately nine am the applicant who had been placed in pretrial detention in Budapest Prison was transported to the premises of the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning He was accompanied by two guards and was handed over for questioning at around ninetwenty am when he showed no sign of injuries\\n\\nsix  The questioning started at approximately ninefiftyfive am and lasted until approximately eleventhirty am It was conducted by police officers A and B The applicant chose not to give a statement\\n\\nseven  On being released after the interrogation the applicant was handed over to the guards of Budapest Prison who in the presence of the police officer asked him whether he had been illtreated The applicant declared that he had not been\\n\\neight  After being transported back to Budapest Prison the applicant underwent a medical examination before his readmission during which he claimed that he had been illtreated by police officer A Certain injuries were noted on the applicant A report was drawn up on the incident and photos were taken of the injuries\\n\\nnine  Right after the medical examination the applicant was again transported to the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning from where he was taken to the military hospital by the police officer conducting his interrogation and allegedly assaulting him At the hospital he was examined in the presence of the police officer The medical report noted bleeding on the lower lip jaw sensitive to pressure and bruises on the ribs all likely to heal within eight days\\n\\nten  According to the applicants submission following his return to Budapest Prison he was again subjected to a medical examination\\n\\neleven  The police report filed by A on nineteen July two thousand and twelve stated that the applicant had not been illtreated during questioning None of the police officers had seen the applicant harming himself but A had observed him biting his nails and lips Also according to the report the applicant had been left alone for a few minutes at the police station without constant surveillance\\n\\ntwelve  On twenty July two thousand and twelve the applicant complained of a headache and dizziness and was again examined by medical staff at Budapest Prison He asserted that he had been illtreated during his interrogation The medical report recorded the following injuries swelling on the right cheek head sensitive to pressure bruising on the lower lip and abrasions on the lower right ribs and on the left shoulder blade\\n\\nthirteen  Budapest Prison initiated criminal proceedings on charges of forced interrogation Furthermore the applicants statements given during the medical examination see paragraph eight above were qualified as a criminal complaint by the investigation authorities\\n\\nfourteen  In the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the Central Investigation Office the applicant gave a testimony on fourteen November two thousand and twelve stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head neck and back He had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up he had been slapped four or five times in the face He had been shown the results of a DNA test and when he refused to comment on it had again been beaten by the police officer The same police officer had also punched him in the mouth when he had failed to recognise a person shown to him in a photograph He had been pushed against the door and when he again fell over the police officer had kicked him on his left side\\n\\nfifteen  On twentyfour July two thousand and thirteen one of the prisoner escort officers C was questioned and recalled that the applicant had complained of illtreatment upon his return to the prison facility which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicants body He also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicants face following the medical examination at Budapest Prison He had asked the applicant why he had not complained of his illtreatment earlier to which the applicant had replied that he had been afraid of the police officers According to C as a general practice detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselves\\n\\nsixteen  On twentyfive July two thousand and thirteen D the other prisoner escort officer who accompanied the applicant to his interrogation was also heard as a witness He did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer He had a vague recollection that since there had been some complaints from the applicants side once they had arrived back at the prison facility they had had to transfer him back to the police department He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicants face following interrogation they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been illtreated by the police officers Therefore in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogation\\n\\nseventeen  On six October two thousand and thirteen E the prison security officer who had taken photos of the applicants injuries during his readmission was questioned as a witness He could not give any details of the incident He could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination but suggested that the applicants injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff which was why he had been called on to take photos\\n\\neighteen  On eighteen November two thousand and thirteen F the nurse on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned but she did not remember the incident She could only confirm that if she had seen the applicants injuries prior to his transfer she would surely have inquired about their origin Examining the photos of the applicant she asserted that the bruises on the applicants face would have occurred immediately after an impact and that the applicant could have caused them himself\\n\\nnineteen  On five December two thousand and thirteen G the guard on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned as a witness he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint He nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo he would surely have inquired about their origin\\n\\ntwenty  On two January two thousand and fourteen the Central Investigation Office also heard evidence from H and I two prison escort officers from Budapest Prison who had been on duty on the day of the incident and who were responsible for transferring detainees to the healthcare facilities They did not remember the applicant and could not recall the circumstances of his medical examination or admission to the prison since as one of them explained they were responsible for escorting thirty to forty prisoners a day H stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations whereas I asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in socalled healthcare waiting rooms Neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicant\\n\\ntwentyone  On the same day three members of the medical staff of Budapest Prison were also heard as witnesses Two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases Another member of the healthcare staff stated that she had a recollection of an incident but was not sure whether it involved the applicant or another person As a general rule the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries Examining the photos of the applicant two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos they werent even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicants face while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was taken\\n\\ntwentytwo  The prison doctor was also questioned the same day She could not identify the applicant did not remember whether she had met him had no recollection of the incident and could only recount what she had previously stated in the medical report However she stated that if the applicant had been left alone he could have inflicted the injuries on himself\\n\\ntwentythree  The Central Investigation Office commissioned a forensic expert opinion According to the expert assessment the applicants account of the origins of his injuries was implausible since if he had been illtreated in the way described by him his injuries would have been of a more serious nature Furthermore the location of the injuries had not corresponded to the applicants description of the incident either The report stated that it was impossible to establish when the applicants injuries had occurred Referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himself\\n\\ntwentyfour  The investigation was discontinued on eight May two thousand and fourteen on the grounds that the applicants allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion According to the reasoning the available evidence neither refuted nor proved the applicants allegations The applicant complained seeking the continuation of the investigations The firstinstance decision was upheld by the Chief Prosecutors Office on fifteen July two thousand and fourteen The decision called the applicants attention to the possibility of lodging of initiating substitute private prosecution proceedings\\n\\nII  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW\\n\\ntwentyfive  The relevant domestic law is set out in Borbála Kiss v Hungary no fiftynine thousand two hundred and fourteeneleven  seventeen twentysix

       "0  \\n\\nI  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION\\n\\ntwentysix  The applicant complained that he had been illtreated by the police and that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the illtreatment in breach of Article three of the Convention which provides\\n\\nNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\\n\\nA  Admissibility\\n\\none  The parties submissions\\n\\na  The Government\\n\\ntwentyseven  The Government first objected that the application was inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies They submitted that the applicant should have pursued substitute private prosecution proceedings which could have remedied the alleged violation of the States procedural obligations  and in particular the obligation incumbent on the prosecution authorities to take the necessary steps to establish the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators They added that if the applicants motion for private prosecution proceedings had been dismissed by the firstinstance court he could have either appealed against this decision or lodged a constitutional complaint\\n\\ntwentyeight  The Government also submitted that the Courts findings in Borbála Kiss v Hungary cited above  twentyfivetwentysix and Gubacsi v Hungary no fortyfour thousand six hundred and eightysixseven  thirtyonethirtytwo twentyeight June two thousand and eleven were not applicable in the present case since in those cases the reason for dismissing the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies had been the apparent legal uncertainty concerning substitute private prosecution proceedings The Government further suggested that the Court should take the same approach as it had in the case of Horváth and Vadászi v Hungary dec no two thousand three hundred and fiftyonesix nine November two thousand and ten which was declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remedies\\n\\ntwentynine  The Government also argued that the admittedly low success rate of substitute private prosecution proceedings did not mean that this procedure was inefficient since the dismissal of such applications was mainly due to noncompliance with the relevant formal requirements\\n\\nb  The applicant\\n\\nthirty  The applicant for his part submitted that the Government had not produced any evidence to show that substitute private prosecution proceedings had been an effective remedy in cases similar to his and would therefore constitute a remedy to be exhausted in the circumstances He argued that he had sought redress through the available national channels by lodging a criminal complaint The mere fact that his attention had been drawn to the possibility of acting as a substitute private prosecutor had not in itself rendered this legal avenue an effective remedy to be exhausted He lodged a criminal complaint by which the responsibility to pursue the prosecution of officers accused of illtreatment lay with the public prosecutor and there was no reason to require him to have pursued the prosecution of the accused officers of his own motion\\n\\ntwo  The Courts assessment\\n\\nthirtyone  The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for alleged breaches alleged to have taken place see Pyrantienė v Lithuania no fortyfive thousand and ninetytwoseven  twentysix twelve November two thousand and thirteen An applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried other remedies that were available but probably no more likely to be successful see Hristovi v Bulgaria no fortytwo thousand six hundred and ninetysevenfive  fiftytwo eleven October two thousand and eleven and the cases cited therein\\n\\nthirtytwo  The Court notes that in the present case during his first medical examination the applicant declared that he had been illtreated by the police see paragraph eight above His statements were qualified as criminal complaints by the investigating authorities see paragraph thirteen above Subsequently a criminal investigation was opened against unknown perpetrators for illtreatment in the course of official proceedings Following the firstinstance decision discontinuing proceedings the applicant lodged a complaint seeking continuation of the investigations see paragraph twentyfour above There is nothing to indicate that the ensuing proceedings would not in principle have been capable of leading to the identification and if appropriate punishment of those responsible\\n\\nthirtythree  In the Courts view by virtue of that remedy the State had been afforded an opportunity to put matters right The applicant must therefore be regarded as having brought the substance of his complaint to the notice of the national authorities and as having sought redress for his complaint through the domestic channels He was thus not required additionally to pursue the matter by instituting substitute private prosecution proceedings which would have had the same objective as his appeal against the discontinuation of the investigation see for similar reasoning RB v Hungary no sixtyfour thousand six hundred and twotwelve  sixtytwo twelve April two thousand and sixteen\\n\\nthirtyfour  In particular the Court cannot subscribe to the Governments view see paragraph twentyeight above that in the cases of Borbála Kiss and Gubacsi both cited above the applicants were not required to pursue private prosecution proceedings only because of the uncertainty prevailing at that time concerning the effectiveness of that legal avenue Indeed an additional important consideration was the fact that the applicants had already lodged a criminal complaint concerning the alleged illtreatment so that that they could not be expected to have lodged a second virtually identical complaint mentioning particular individuals by name see Borbála Kiss cited above  twentysix and Gubacsi cited above  thirtytwo As to the Governments reference to the Horváth and Vadászi decision cited above the Court considers that the related conclusions reached in that case are not applicable to the present circumstances since in that case the Court found that the applicants had not raised the essence of their claim  which was racial discrimination  in their private bill of indictment which was concerned with endangering minors\\n\\nthirtyfive  It follows that the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed Furthermore the Court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissible\\n\\nB  Merits\\n\\none  The parties submissions\\n\\na  The applicant\\n\\nthirtysix  The applicant maintained that he had suffered physical illtreatment during his interrogation He further submitted that he could not have inflicted the injuries on himself since he had been held in a waist restraint belt during his transportation in the special vehicle and had otherwise been held under constant supervision He argued that the investigating authorities should have obtained evidence in this respect Furthermore the domestic authorities had no basis for arriving at the conclusion that his injuries had been caused by his own conduct He also submitted that in line with the procedural rules concerning readmission to prison he had undergone a medical checkup for a third time on nineteen July two thousand and twelve see paragraph ten above but the report drawn up during this examination had not formed part of the investigation carried out by the domestic authorities\\n\\nthirtyseven  The applicant emphasised that in line with the Courts caselaw the burden of proof rested on the Government to show how and when the injuries of an individual taken into police custody in good health but found to be injured at the time of release had been sustained The Government however had failed plausibly to explain how when and where the injuries had occurred if not at the police station He questioned the authority of the witness testimonies which had been taken more than a year after the incident concerning the origin of his injuries\\n\\nthirtyeight  The applicant further submitted that the investigation into his allegations had not been adequate for the purpose of Article three Most importantly the investigating authorities had not obtained evidence from the witnesses in due time and the investigation file had not contained all the medical documentation which could have substantiated his allegation of illtreatment They had also failed to question the police officer besides A who had been present for a brief period during the applicants interrogation Moreover the domestic authorities had based their finding solely on the forensic medical expert opinion which had not provided a plausible explanation for the cause of the injuries and had not taken any further investigative steps\\n\\nb  The Government\\n\\nthirtynine  The Government submitted that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been illtreated by the police officer First they highlighted the contradictions between the applicants account of events  namely that he had been beaten for several minutes with great force  and the findings of the forensic expert opinion according to which the applicants injuries had been of a minor severity Furthermore according to the prosecutors office the applicant had not been constantly monitored thus he could have inflicted the injuries on himself In this respect the Government also emphasised that there was no evidence that the applicant had been restrained during his transportation and the witness testimonies had not shed light on this question either Moreover the applicant had only complained of illtreatment following his transfer back to Budapest Prison and not immediately after his handover from the police to the prison escort officers The Government lastly pointed to the witness testimony of one of the medical staff who had commented when examining the photograph of the applicant that she could not be certain whether he actually had an injury on his face or merely pronounced cheekbones see paragraph twentyone above\\n\\ntwo  The Courts assessment\\n\\na  Concerning the alleged illtreatment\\n\\nforty  As the Court has stated on many occasions Article three of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment irrespective of the circumstances or the conduct of the person concerned see Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine  eightyone ECHR two thousand and fifteen with further references Illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article three The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case such as the duration of the treatment its physical or mental effects and in some cases the sex age and state of health of the victim see Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and fiftynine ECHR two thousand and sixteen extracts\\n\\nfortyone  Allegations of illtreatment contrary to Article three must be supported by appropriate evidence To assess this evidence the Court adopts the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightytwo\\n\\nfortytwo  On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities as in the case of persons within their control in custody strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention The burden of proof then rests with the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw interferences which may be unfavourable for the Government That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightythree\\n\\nfortythree  In the instant case the applicant complained that during his interrogation he was subjected to acts of police brutality The Court notes that medical reports confirmed that the applicant had suffered bleeding on the lower lip bruises on the ribs and sensitivity at his jaw see paragraph nine above The Court considers that in the instant case the injury suffered by the applicant was sufficiently serious to amount to illtreatment within the scope of Article three\\n\\nfortyfour  In the light of the parties submissions the witness testimonies and the relevant medical evidence it is uncontested that the applicants injuries were sustained while under the control of the state authorities either during his questioning at the police station or thereafter when he was being transferred or readmitted to the prison see paragraphs nine and fifteentwentytwo aboveThe disagreement between the parties concerned the exact nature and causes of the applicants injuries\\n\\nfortyfive  The Court observes that the investigation into forced interrogation was discontinued on the grounds that the applicants statements could not be corroborated by any testimony in the absence of eye witnesses during questioning see paragraph twentyfour above Moreover the forensic expert opinion did not confirm the applicants account of the incident stating that the nature of the injuries excluded that they could have been caused by the mechanism described by the applicant That opinion even assumed based on the location of the injuries that they could have been selfinflicted see paragraph twentythree above This conclusion was also supported by the Government in their submissions see paragraph thirtynine above\\n\\nfortysix  It is true that no conclusive evidence is available concerning the time at which the injuries occurred and the other circumstances surrounding the incident In particular the Court finds no elements which could indicate with sufficient certainty that the injuries sustained by the applicant were inflicted by use of force by the police Furthermore there is no evidence in the case file which could call into question the findings of the medical report or could add probative weight to the applicants allegations\\n\\nfortyseven  In the light of the foregoing the Court cannot consider it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was subjected to illtreatment during his time in police custody\\n\\nfortyeight  It follows that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention under its substantive aspect\\n\\nb  Concerning the alleged inadequacy of the investigation\\n\\nfortynine  The Court refers to the general principles set out among other judgments in ElMasri v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia GC no thirtynine thousand six hundred and thirtynine  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive ECHR two thousand and twelve and Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts among other judgments Those principles indicate in particular that the investigation into serious allegations of illtreatment must be both prompt and thorough and authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including inter alia eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standard\\n\\nfifty  In the present case the Court finds that the applicants injuries were serious enough see paragraphs nine and fortythree above and that his complaint of illtreatment was arguable for the purposes of Article three thus requiring the domestic authorities to carry out an effective investigation\\n\\nfiftyone  The Court observes that in the present case it was established that the applicant had no injuries before the interrogation and that the key element of consideration for the investigation authorities was whether the applicant could have inflicted the injuries on himself a possibility suggested by the forensic expert opinion see paragraph twentythree above The only viable means for the Central Investigation Office to obtain certainty on this point would have been to hear the testimony of the police officers present during his questioning A and B of the escort officers accompanying the applicant during his transfer in an outside the prison facilities C D E G H and I and of the medical staff who examined the applicant before his readmission F the three members of the medical staff mentioned in paragraph twentyone above and the prison doctor\\n\\nfiftytwo  However the investigating authorities obtained such testimony from the prison escort officers and medical staff only after a certain period of time had lapsed in some cases more than a year after the incident see paragraphs fifteen to twentytwo above At this point most of the witnesses no longer had any recollection whatsoever of the events and could not even recognise the applicant from a photo Even those officers on duty who had been with the applicant for an extended time could not recall the exact details of his transfer This was mainly so according to the witnesses own assessment because they had been responsible for the admission transfer and examination of a large number of detainees on a daily basis making it impossible to distinguish cases after a certain lapse of time The witnesses could therefore only reply to the investigation authorities questions in a general manner or theoretically without an actual link to the present case For the Court the delay in questioning the witnesses significantly tainted the official investigation being pursued by the State authorities which was not redressed by the fact that they were ultimately heard in the course of the investigations\\n\\nfiftythree  On the other hand the Court observes that the names of the persons on duty on the day of the incident must have been easily accessible to the investigation authorities Moreover there is nothing in the case file  and the Government did not provide any elements either  indicating that the investigation authorities had been prevented from questioning the witnesses in due time In the Courts view the prosecutors office made no genuine efforts for a considerable length of time to establish how the applicants injuries could have occurred\\n\\nfiftyfour  The Court further observes that the applicant alleged that he had been illtreated by police officer A However neither he nor B the other police officer present during the questioning according to the police report see paragraphs six and eleven above was questioned during the investigation The unsatisfactory course of action followed by the domestic authorities was unlikely to shed light on the central element of their inquiry namely whether the police officer used force against the applicant during interrogation\\n\\nfiftyfive  Similarly no further measures were taken with a view to resolving the discrepancy between the version of events documented in the police report and the allegations of the applicant A possible investigative measure in this respect could have been to organise a facetoface confrontation see mutatis mutandis Bouyid cited above  one hundred and twentyeight in order to assess the credibility of each sides statements as regards the facts\\n\\nfiftysix  Given the above the Court finds that the authorities did not do all that could have been reasonably expected of them to investigate the incident\\n\\nfiftyseven  Accordingly the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation into the applicants complaint and that there has therefore been a violation of Article three of the Convention in its procedural limb\\n\\nII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTION\\n\\nfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention provides\\n\\nIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured party\\n\\nA  Damage\\n\\nfiftynine  The applicant claimed tenzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damage\\n\\nsixty  The Government contested this claim\\n\\nsixtyone  Taking into account all the circumstances of the present case the Court accepts that the applicant has suffered nonpecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation Making its assessment on an equitable basis the Court awards the applicant EUR sixzero in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable\\n\\nB  Costs and expenses\\n\\nsixtytwo  The applicant also claimed EUR sixfour hundred plus VAT for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court This amount corresponded to thirtytwo hours of legal work billable by his lawyer at an hourly rate of EUR two hundred plus VAT\\n\\nsixtythree  The Government contested this claim\\n\\nsixtyfour  According to the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum In the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR twozero for the proceedings before the Court\\n\\nC  Default interest\\n\\nsixtyfive  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points\\n\\n   \n",

dizziness and was again examined by medical staff at Budapest Prison He asserted that he had been illtreated during his interrogation The medical report recorded the following injuries swelling on the right cheek head sensitive to pressure bruising on the lower lip and abrasions on the lower right ribs and on the left shoulder bladethirteen  Budapest Prison initiated criminal proceedings on charges of forced interrogation Furthermore the applicants statements given during the medical examination see paragraph eight above were qualified as a criminal complaint by the investigation authoritiesfourteen  In the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the Central Investigation Office the applicant gave a testimony on fourteen November two thousand and twelve stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head neck and back He had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up he had been slapped four or five times in the face He had been shown the results of a DNA test and when he refused to comment on it had again been beaten by the police officer The same police officer had also punched him in the mouth when he had failed to recognise a person shown to him in a photograph He had been pushed against the door and when he again fell over the police officer had kicked him on his left sidefifteen  On twentyfour July two thousand and thirteen one of the prisoner escort officers C was questioned and recalled that the applicant had complained of illtreatment upon his return to the prison facility which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicants body He also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicants face following the medical examination at Budapest Prison He had asked the applicant why he had not complained of his illtreatment earlier to which the applicant had replied that he had been afraid of the police officers According to C as a general practice detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselvessixteen  On twentyfive July two thousand and thirteen D the other prisoner escort officer who accompanied the applicant to his interrogation was also heard as a witness He did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer He had a vague recollection that since there had been some complaints from the applicants side once they had arrived back at the prison facility they had had to transfer him back to the police department He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicants face following interrogation they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been illtreated by the police officers Therefore in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogationseventeen  On six October two thousand and thirteen E the prison security officer who had taken photos of the applicants injuries during his readmission was questioned as a witness He could not give any details of the incident He could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination but suggested that the applicants injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff which was why he had been called on to take photoseighteen  On eighteen November two thousand and thirteen F the nurse on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned but she did not remember the incident She could only confirm that if she had seen the applicants injuries prior to his transfer she would surely have inquired about their origin Examining the photos of the applicant she asserted that the bruises on the applicants face would have occurred immediately after an impact and that the applicant could have caused them himselfnineteen  On five December two thousand and thirteen G the guard on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned as a witness he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint He nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo he would surely have inquired about their origintwenty  On two January two thousand and fourteen the Central Investigation Office also heard evidence from H and I two prison escort officers from Budapest Prison who had been on duty on the day of the incident and who were responsible for transferring detainees to the healthcare facilities They did not remember the applicant and could not recall the circumstances of his medical examination or admission to the prison since as one of them explained they were responsible for escorting thirty to forty prisoners a day H stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations whereas I asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in socalled healthcare waiting rooms Neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicanttwentyone  On the same day three members of the medical staff of Budapest Prison were also heard as witnesses Two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases Another member of the healthcare staff stated that she had a recollection of an incident but was not sure whether it involved the applicant or another person As a general rule the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries Examining the photos of the applicant two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos they werent even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicants face while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was takentwentytwo  The prison doctor was also questioned the same day She could not identify the applicant did not remember whether she had met him had no recollection of the incident and could only recount what she had previously stated in the medical report However she stated that if the applicant had been left alone he could have inflicted the injuries on himselftwentythree  The Central Investigation Office commissioned a forensic expert opinion According to the expert assessment the applicants account of the origins of his injuries was implausible since if he had been illtreated in the way described by him his injuries would have been of a more serious nature Furthermore the location of the injuries had not corresponded to the applicants description of the incident either The report stated that it was impossible to establish when the applicants injuries had occurred Referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himselftwentyfour  The investigation was discontinued on eight May two thousand and fourteen on the grounds that the applicants allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion According to the reasoning the available evidence neither refuted nor proved the applicants allegations The applicant complained seeking the continuation of the investigations The firstinstance decision was upheld by the Chief Prosecutors Office on fifteen July two thousand and fourteen The decision called the applicants attention to the possibility of lodging of initiating substitute private prosecution proceedingsII  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAWtwentyfive  The relevant domestic law is set out in Borbála Kiss v Hungary no fiftynine thousand

       "      <td>I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTIONtwentysix  The applicant complained that he had been illtreated by the police and that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the illtreatment in breach of Article three of the Convention which providesNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilityone  The parties submissionsa  The Governmenttwentyseven  The Government first objected that the application was inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies They submitted that the applicant should have pursued substitute private prosecution proceedings which could have remedied the alleged violation of the States procedural obligations  and in particular the obligation incumbent on the prosecution authorities to take the necessary steps to establish the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators They added that if the applicants motion for private prosecution proceedings had been dismissed by the firstinstance court he could have either appealed against this decision or lodged a constitutional complainttwentyeight  The Government also submitted that the Courts findings in Borbála Kiss v Hungary cited above  twentyfivetwentysix and Gubacsi v Hungary no fortyfour thousand six hundred and eightysixseven  thirtyonethirtytwo twentyeight June two thousand and eleven were not applicable in the present case since in those cases the reason for dismissing the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies had been the apparent legal uncertainty concerning substitute private prosecution proceedings The Government further suggested that the Court should take the same approach as it had in the case of Horváth and Vadászi v Hungary dec no two thousand three hundred and fiftyonesix nine November two thousand and ten which was declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remediestwentynine  The Government also argued that the admittedly low success rate of substitute private prosecution proceedings did not mean that this procedure was inefficient since the dismissal of such applications was mainly due to noncompliance with the relevant formal requirementsb  The applicantthirty  The applicant for his part submitted that the Government had not produced any evidence to show that substitute private prosecution proceedings had been an effective remedy in cases similar to his and would therefore constitute a remedy to be exhausted in the circumstances He argued that he had sought redress through the available national channels by lodging a criminal complaint The mere fact that his attention had been drawn to the possibility of acting as a substitute private prosecutor had not in itself rendered this legal avenue an effective remedy to be exhausted He lodged a criminal complaint by which the responsibility to pursue the prosecution of officers accused of illtreatment lay with the public prosecutor and there was no reason to require him to have pursued the prosecution of the accused officers of his own motiontwo  The Courts assessmentthirtyone  The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for alleged breaches alleged to have taken place see Pyrantienė v Lithuania no fortyfive thousand and ninetytwoseven  twentysix twelve November two thousand and thirteen An applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried other remedies that were available but probably no more likely to be successful see Hristovi v Bulgaria no fortytwo thousand six hundred and ninetysevenfive  fiftytwo eleven October two thousand and eleven and the cases cited thereinthirtytwo  The Court notes that in the present case during his first medical examination the applicant declared that he had been illtreated by the police see paragraph eight above His statements were qualified as criminal complaints by the investigating authorities see paragraph thirteen above Subsequently a criminal investigation was opened against unknown perpetrators for illtreatment in the course of official proceedings Following the firstinstance decision discontinuing proceedings the applicant lodged a complaint seeking continuation of the investigations see paragraph twentyfour above There is nothing to indicate that the ensuing proceedings would not in principle have been capable of leading to the identification and if appropriate punishment of those responsiblethirtythree  In the Courts view by virtue of that remedy the State had been afforded an opportunity to put matters right The applicant must therefore be regarded as having brought the substance of his complaint to the notice of the national authorities and as having sought redress for his complaint through the domestic channels He was thus not required additionally to pursue the matter by instituting substitute private prosecution proceedings which would have had the same objective as his appeal against the discontinuation of the investigation see for similar reasoning RB v Hungary no sixtyfour thousand six hundred and twotwelve  sixtytwo twelve April two thousand and sixteenthirtyfour  In particular the Court cannot subscribe to the Governments view see paragraph twentyeight above that in the cases of Borbála Kiss and Gubacsi both cited above the applicants were not required to pursue private prosecution proceedings only because of the uncertainty prevailing at that time concerning the effectiveness of that legal avenue Indeed an additional important consideration was the fact that the applicants had already lodged a criminal complaint concerning the alleged illtreatment so that that they could not be expected to have lodged a second virtually identical complaint mentioning particular individuals by name see Borbála Kiss cited above  twentysix and Gubacsi cited above  thirtytwo As to the Governments reference to the Horváth and Vadászi decision cited above the Court considers that the related conclusions reached in that case are not applicable to the present circumstances since in that case the Court found that the applicants had not raised the essence of their claim  which was racial discrimination  in their private bill of indictment which was concerned with endangering minorsthirtyfive  It follows that the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed Furthermore the Court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone  The parties submissionsa  The applicantthirtysix  The applicant maintained that he had suffered physical illtreatment during his interrogation He further submitted that he could not have inflicted the injuries on himself since he had been held in a waist restraint belt during his transportation in the special vehicle and had otherwise been held under constant supervision He argued that the investigating authorities should have obtained evidence in this respect Furthermore the domestic authorities had no basis for arriving at the conclusion that his injuries had been caused by his own conduct He also submitted that in line with the procedural rules concerning readmission to prison he had undergone a medical checkup for a third time on nineteen July two thousand and twelve see paragraph ten above but the report drawn up during this examination had not formed part of the investigation carried out by the domestic authoritiesthirtyseven  The applicant emphasised that in line with the Courts caselaw the burden of proof rested on the Government to show how and when the injuries of an individual taken into police custody in good health but found to be injured at the time of release had been sustained The Government however had failed plausibly to explain how when and where the injuries had occurred if not at the police station He questioned the authority of the witness testimonies which had been taken more than a year after the incident concerning the origin of his injuriesthirtyeight  The applicant further submitted that the investigation into his allegations had not been adequate for the purpose of Article three Most importantly the investigating authorities had not obtained evidence from the witnesses in due time and the investigation file had not contained all the medical documentation which could have substantiated his allegation of illtreatment They had also failed to question the police officer besides A who had been present for a brief period during the applicants interrogation Moreover the domestic authorities had based their finding solely on the forensic medical expert opinion which had not provided a plausible explanation for the cause of the injuries and had not taken any further investigative stepsb  The Governmentthirtynine  The Government submitted that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been illtreated by the police officer First they highlighted the contradictions between the applicants account of events  namely that he had been beaten for several minutes with great force  and the findings of the forensic expert opinion according to which the applicants injuries had been of a minor severity Furthermore according to the prosecutors office the applicant had not been constantly monitored thus he could have inflicted the injuries on himself In this respect the Government also emphasised that there was no evidence that the applicant had been restrained during his transportation and the witness testimonies had not shed light on this question either Moreover the applicant had only complained of illtreatment following his transfer back to Budapest Prison and not immediately after his handover from the police to the prison escort officers The Government lastly pointed to the witness testimony of one of the medical staff who had commented when examining the photograph of the applicant that she could not be certain whether he actually had an injury on his face or merely pronounced cheekbones see paragraph twentyone abovetwo  The Courts assessmenta  Concerning the alleged illtreatmentforty  As the Court has stated on many occasions Article three of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment irrespective of the circumstances or the conduct of the person concerned see Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine  eightyone ECHR two thousand and fifteen with further references Illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article three The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case such as the duration of the treatment its physical or mental effects and in some cases the sex age and state of health of the victim see Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and fiftynine ECHR two thousand and sixteen extractsfortyone  Allegations of illtreatment contrary to Article three must be supported by appropriate evidence To assess this evidence the Court adopts the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightytwofortytwo  On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities as in the case of persons within their control in custody strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention The burden of proof then rests with the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw interferences which may be unfavourable for the Government That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightythreefortythree  In the instant case the applicant complained that during his interrogation he was subjected to acts of police brutality The Court notes that medical reports confirmed that the applicant had suffered bleeding on the lower lip bruises on the ribs and sensitivity at his jaw see paragraph nine above The Court considers that in the instant case the injury suffered by the applicant was sufficiently serious to amount to illtreatment within the scope of Article threefortyfour  In the light of the parties submissions the witness testimonies and the relevant medical evidence it is uncontested that the applicants injuries were sustained while under the control of the state authorities either during his questioning at the police station or thereafter when he was being transferred or readmitted to the prison see paragraphs nine and fifteentwentytwo aboveThe disagreement between the parties concerned the exact nature and causes of the applicants injuriesfortyfive  The Court observes that the investigation into forced interrogation was discontinued on the grounds that the applicants statements could not be corroborated by any testimony in the absence of eye witnesses during questioning see paragraph twentyfour above Moreover the forensic expert opinion did not confirm the applicants account of the incident stating that the nature of the injuries excluded that they could have been caused by the mechanism described by the applicant That opinion even assumed based on the location of the injuries that they could have been selfinflicted see paragraph twentythree above This conclusion was also supported by the Government in their submissions see paragraph thirtynine abovefortysix  It is true that no conclusive evidence is available concerning the time at which the injuries occurred and the other circumstances surrounding the incident In particular the Court finds no elements which could indicate with sufficient certainty that the injuries sustained by the applicant were inflicted by use of force by the police Furthermore there is no evidence in the case file which could call into question the findings of the medical report or could add probative weight to the applicants allegationsfortyseven  In the light of the foregoing the Court cannot consider it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was subjected to illtreatment during his time in police custodyfortyeight  It follows that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention under its substantive aspectb  Concerning the alleged inadequacy of the investigationfortynine  The Court refers to the general principles set out among other judgments in ElMasri v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia GC no thirtynine thousand six hundred and thirtynine  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive ECHR two thousand and twelve and Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts among other judgments Those principles indicate in particular that the investigation into serious allegations of illtreatment must be both prompt and thorough and authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including inter alia eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standardfifty  In the present case the Court finds that the applicants injuries were serious enough see paragraphs nine and fortythree above and that his complaint of illtreatment was arguable for the purposes of Article three thus requiring the domestic authorities to carry out an effective investigationfiftyone  The Court observes that in the present case it was established that the applicant had no injuries before the interrogation and that the key element of consideration for the investigation authorities was whether the applicant could have inflicted the injuries on himself a possibility suggested by the forensic expert opinion see paragraph twentythree above The only viable means for the Central Investigation Office to obtain certainty on this point would have been to hear the testimony of the police officers present during his questioning A and B of the escort officers accompanying the applicant during his transfer in an outside the prison facilities C D E G H and I and of the medical staff who examined the applicant before his readmission F the three members of the medical staff mentioned in paragraph twentyone above and the prison doctorfiftytwo  However the investigating authorities obtained such testimony from the prison escort officers and medical staff only after a certain period of time had lapsed in some cases more than a year after the incident see paragraphs fifteen to twentytwo above At this point most of the witnesses no longer had any recollection whatsoever of the events and could not even recognise the applicant from a photo Even those officers on duty who had been with the applicant for an extended time could not recall the exact details of his transfer This was mainly so according to the witnesses own assessment because they had been responsible for the admission transfer and examination of a large number of detainees on a daily basis making it impossible to distinguish cases after a certain lapse of time The witnesses could therefore only reply to the investigation authorities questions in a general manner or theoretically without an actual link to the present case For the Court the delay in questioning the witnesses significantly tainted the official investigation being pursued by the State authorities which was not redressed by the fact that they were ultimately heard in the course of the investigationsfiftythree  On the other hand the Court observes that the names of the persons on duty on the day of the incident must have been easily accessible to the investigation authorities Moreover there is nothing in the case file  and the Government did not provide any elements either  indicating that the investigation authorities had been prevented from questioning the witnesses in due time In the Courts view the prosecutors office made no genuine efforts for a considerable length of time to establish how the applicants injuries could have occurredfiftyfour  The Court further observes that the applicant alleged that he had been illtreated by police officer A However neither he nor B the other police officer present during the questioning according to the police report see paragraphs six and eleven above was questioned during the investigation The unsatisfactory course of action followed by the domestic authorities was unlikely to shed light on the central element of their inquiry namely whether the police officer used force against the applicant during interrogationfiftyfive  Similarly no further measures were taken with a view to resolving the discrepancy between the version of events documented in the police report and the allegations of the applicant A possible investigative measure in this respect could have been to organise a facetoface confrontation see mutatis mutandis Bouyid cited above  one hundred and twentyeight in order to assess the credibility of each sides statements as regards the factsfiftysix  Given the above the Court finds that the authorities did not do all that could have been reasonably expected of them to investigate the incidentfiftyseven  Accordingly the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation into the applicants complaint and that there has therefore been a violation of Article three of the Convention in its procedural limbII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damagefiftynine  The applicant claimed tenzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damagesixty  The Government contested this claimsixtyone  Taking into account all the circumstances of the present case the Court accepts that the

in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeableB  Costs and expensessixtytwo  The applicant also claimed EUR sixfour hundred plus VAT for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court This amount corresponded to thirtytwo hours of legal work billable by his lawyer at an hourly rate of EUR two hundred plus VATsixtythree  The Government contested this

placed after twentyeight October two thousand and ten were significantly better in terms of heating lighting and hygiene and were satisfactory Food was also of good quality Taking a shower however was

       "      <td>I  SCOPE OF THE CASEnineteen  After notice of the application was given to the Government in his observations of twentynine March two thousand and sixteen in reply to those of the Government the applicant who suffers from thyroid dysfunction and arthritis complained under Article three of the Convention that he had not been provided with proper health care for these medical conditions in custody Relying on the same Article he also complained that his mother had died in February two thousand and sixteen because he had been unable to take care of her owing to the authorities refusal to interrupt the serving of his sentence or to grant him early releasetwenty  The Government did not comment on these pointstwentyone  The Court notes that in his initial application the applicant did not raise a complaint about the lack of proper medical care in custody separate from the complaint about the material conditions of his detention In his initial application he did rely on Article three of the Convention with regard to the authorities refusal to interrupt the serving of his sentence in two thousand and nine when his mother had undergone hipreplacement surgery and with regard to the prison authorities alleged failure to manage properly the hunger strike which he had undertaken to protest against that refusal those complaints were declared inadmissible by the President under Rule fiftyfour  three of the Rules of Court However the two complaints raised after notice of the application was given to the Government concern new facts which took place several years after the lodging of the application in two thousand and ninetwentytwo  In these circumstances the two complaints raised in the applicants observations in reply to those of the Government must be regarded as new rather than an elaboration of the original complaint concerning the conditions of his detention It is therefore not appropriate to take them up for

that had been given by the applicant and the other people who had either been involved in or had witnessed the brawl on six August two thousand and twelve In so far as relevant the decision stated the followingJK gave information about the event stating that Petri Pihoni had been involved in the dispute having been informed about it by telephone by NP  Petri had struck A who had hit back in response  the police officers had escorted AS NP and Petri to the police station JK saw that both NP and Petri resisted the police officers by declining to get into the police vehicle  JK confirmed that the officers actions were correct  none of them touched or used force against them AS NP and the applicantAE was questioned in relation to the events He runs a private business close to the site His statement indicates that a physical dispute was taking place between three people All the people were having a fight by the time an RRF police car arrived The police officers called on those people to stop fighting but they continued to have a fist fight until the officers intervened pulled them by their arms and got them into the police vehicle AE stated that he had not seen any officers using rubber truncheonsDrawing on the facts and evidence collected during the course of the investigation in respect of criminal file no  three hundred and three the result is that we are not confronted with the criminal offence of the commission of arbitrary actions as provided for by Article two hundred and fifty of the Criminal Code In the instant case it was proved that Petri Pihoni was involved in a physical argument with some people Despite his own statements the statements given by AS JK and AE indicate that NP called Petri who appeared at the scene and became involved in a debate about the sum that NP owed AS The debate escalated into a physical dispute in which Petri struck AS who hit back in responseIn such circumstances the RRF officers witnessed a violent dispute and took the three people to the police station with a view to their giving explanations about its causesI consider that the officers actions  are in compliance with sections four ninetytwo ninetyfive and ninetysix of the State Police Act and cannot be classified as arbitrary actions which affect the freedom of citizensAs regards the criminal complaint that physical violence was used by the RRF officers when Petri was taken to the police station I consider that doubts arise as to whether the offence of abuse of power as provided for by Article two hundred and fortyeight of the CC has been committed This is the case given the injuries sustained by Petri which may have been caused while he was escorted to the police station by RRF officers During the investigation Petri Pihoni was questioned on several occasions as to whether he could identify the RRF officers who might have struck him He responded that he was unable to proceed with the identification procedure because the blows had come from behind and he was unable to identify the officer who had struck the blowsThe remaining evidence obtained during the investigation does not shed any light on this incident Having regard to the fact that criminal responsibility is individual and not collective I consider that the investigation should be stayedB  The applicants requests for informationforty  Having not received

obliged to pay compensation for the damage He is not liable if he proves that he is not at fault Article six hundred and nine provides that the damage should be the result of a persons direct and immediate act or omission Article six hundred and twentyfive provides that a person who suffers nonpecuniary damage is entitled to compensation if there has been damage to his health physical or mental integrity his honour personality or reputation have been infringed or his right to respect for his private life has been infringed Under Article six hundred and forty pecuniary damage consists of the actual loss suffered and loss of profit Under Article six hundred and fortyone a person who causes damage to someone elses health should pay compensationD  Domestic caselaw concerning the payment of damagessixtytwo  The Government submitted some domestic caselaw concerning the payment of damages as part of their observationsIn unifying decision no twelve of fourteen September two thousand and seven following a civil claim for damages against the Albanian Insurance Bureau Byroja Shqiptare e Sigurimeve a State entity under Articles six hundred and twentyfive and six hundred and forty of the Civil Code Kodi Civil for the death of three people in a car accident the Supreme Court ruled as follows domestic courts have accepted that three people lost their lives in a car accident  substantially under Article six hundred and eight of the Civil Codethe legislature provides for the protection of the right to life health personality dignity private life and so on from the unlawful acts of a third party If there is a violation of any of these rights as a result of the unlawful act the injured party has the right to extracontractual compensation  In applying Article six hundred and nine of the Civil Code the causal material link between the unlawful behaviour the act or omission and the fault and the damage should be proved In determining the actual damage caused by the unlawful fact and the relevant compensation the causal judicial link between them should also be provedAn appellant had requested compensation by a State entity under Article six hundred and forty of the Civil Code for damage caused to his health as a result of a firearm injury caused by State police officers In its decision no two hundred and seventyfive of twentyfour September two thousand and nine the Supreme Court remitted the case for reexamination before the relevant court of appeal It reasoned that as a result of the appellants injury by the State police officers it had been duly proved that damage had been caused to his healthIn a decision of twentyfive November two thousand and eleven the Tirana District Court accepted a civil claim by appellants for compensation against State authorities lodged under inter alia Articles six hundred and twentyfive and six hundred and forty of the Civil Code as a result of their family members death in a massive explosion at a demilitarisation facility The court reasoned that criminal responsibility was independent from the civil obligation as to compensation which was only related to compensation for damage inflicted by the dangerous activity of demilitarisation</td>\n",
       "      <td>I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES three AND thirteen OF THE CONVENTIONsixtythree  The applicant complained under Article three regarding the injuries he had sustained as a result of the police intervention and alleged that the investigation with a view to identifying and punishing the perpetrators had not been effective Article three reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentsixtyfour  Having regard to the circumstances of this case the Court considered it appropriate to communicate of its own motion a question under Article thirteen of the Convention which reads as followsEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacitysixtyfive  The Government contested the applicants argumentsA  Admissibilityone  As regards the submission of a civil claim under Articles six hundred and eight et seq of the Civil Code and Article sixtyone of the CCPsixtysix  The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies such as a civil claim for damages under Articles six hundred and eight six hundred and twentyfive and six hundred and forty of the Civil Code and the unifying decision of the Supreme Court of thirteen September two thousand and seven for damage caused by the alleged offence of torture and a civil claim in the course of criminal proceedings under Article sixtyone of the CCPsixtyseven  The applicant submitted that a civil claim for damages could not lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the Article three violation In any event those remedies could only be effective after the cause of the damage had been established The domestic caselaw submitted by the Government was not applicable in his case since all those cases were different from his The criminal proceedings under Article sixtyone of the CCP could only be used in the event that a criminal charge was pressed against someone and the case was sent for trial before the domestic courts Therefore such a claim could not offer any prospects of success in his case since the investigation had been stayed and no charges had been pressed against anyonesixtyeight  The Court reiterates that in the area of unlawful use of force by State agents  and not mere fault omission or negligence  civil or administrative proceedings aimed solely at awarding damages rather than ensuring the identification and punishment of those responsible are not adequate and effective remedies capable of providing redress for complaints based on the substantive aspect of Articles two and three of the Convention see inter alia Yaşa v Turkey two September one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight  seventyfour Reports of Judgments and Decisions one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeightVI Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  two hundred and twentyseven ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts and Jeronovičs v Latvia GC no fortyfour thousand eight hundred and ninetyeightten  seventysix ECHR two thousand and sixteensixtynine  The Contracting Parties obligation under Articles two and three of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of assault could be rendered illusory if in respect of complaints under those Articles an applicant were required to bring an action leading only to an award of damages see Mocanu and Others cited above  two hundred and thirtyfour and Jeronovičs cited above  seventysevenseventy  In the present case the Court notes that the applicant alleged that the State had failed to comply with the obligations imposed on it under the substantive aspect of Article three of the Convention and under the procedural aspect of the said Article to conduct an effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the alleged illtreatment In this connection the Court observes that a civil claim for damages under the Albanian Civil Code and CCP is aimed solely at awarding damages rather than ensuring the identification and punishment of those responsibleseventyone  For the reasons set out above the Court considers that the remedies put forward by the Government are not sufficient in that they are not capable of providing redress for the situation complained of by the applicanttwo  As regards lodging a premature application and an appeal before a higherranking prosecutorseventytwo  The Government submitted that the criminal proceedings had not yet been terminated since the interlocutory decision of seven June two thousand and thirteen had triggered another opportunity to identify the perpetrators The applicant had also failed to lodge an appeal against the prosecutors decision of seven June two thousand and thirteen with a higherranking prosecutor under Article twentyfour of the CCPseventythree  The applicant submitted that the fact that the investigation had been stayed meant that a violation under Article three of the Convention still continued He further argued that no appeal against a prosecutors decision to stay an investigation was provided for in domestic lawseventyfour  The Court notes that one of the applicants complaints is that the investigation of his allegation of illtreatment was ineffective It finds that the Governments objection that the case had not yet been terminated and that the applicant also failed to lodge an appeal under Article twentyfour of the CCP is closely related to his complaint regarding the effectiveness of the investigation It therefore joins this objection to the merits of the case under Articles three and thirteen of the Conventionthree  Conclusionseventyfive  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds They must therefore be declared admissible without prejudice to the decision ultimately to be taken on the Governments objection as to nonexhaustion of domestic remediesB  Meritsone  Alleged violation of the substantive aspect of Article three of the Conventiona  The parties submissionsseventysix  The applicant submitted that the investigation file and the prosecutors decision substantiated the fact that six police officers had used violence against him This had been supported by other witnesses statements The authorities had humiliated him by publicly using violence They had used rubber truncheons on him in front of his fellow citizens causing him serious injuries There was no evidence that the applicant had caused the fight or been a protagonist Furthermore there had been no use of any blunt objects by the applicant or the other people involved in the fight None of the witnesses had stated that those objects had been used at the scene The applicant further submitted that the Government had failed to show any specific behaviour on his part that had necessitated the use of violence by the police including the unlimited use of force Therefore the authorities had used unnecessary and disproportionate force against him resulting in serious damage to his health The police actions had been unplanned unorganised and unprofessional Indeed it had not been the RRF police officers duty to protect public order in the city The authorities acts had constituted inhuman and degrading treatmentseventyseven  The Government submitted that the factual circumstances of the case did not disclose that the applicant had been subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment There had been no evidence to substantiate or create any suspicion that the police officers had used violence against him or that his injuries had been caused by them The applicants statements did not constitute a credible assertion as they were contradictory The investigation had proved the fact that the applicant had been a protagonist in the physical dispute which had resulted in the use of beer bottles and other hard objects Except for the applicants inconsistent statements there had been no other statements saying that the police officers had used objects like these There was no basis for saying that the applicants injuries had not been caused as a result of his physical dispute with the other people Furthermore the witnesses had not stated that they had had a physical dispute with the police The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt had not been met in the present case The violence used by the police officers if any used with the aim of protecting others involved in the fight could not be qualified as torture within the meaning of Article three of the Conventionb  The Courts assessmentseventyeight  The Court refers to the general principles set out in Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine   eightyoneninety ECHR two thousand and fifteenseventynine  The Court notes that the material in its possession conclusively demonstrates that on the day of the events in issue the applicant sustained injuries Indeed the forensic medical report produced a day after the events on seven August two thousand and twelve  the authenticity of which is not contested  mentions that the applicant was injured by a hard blunt object mjet i fortë mbretës see paragraph twenty above Furthermore the applicant was unable to work for nine days Therefore the Court concludes that the applicants injuries were sufficiently serious to fall within the ambit of Article three of the Conventioneighty  The Court observes at the outset that the parties are in dispute about whether the applicant was subjected to the use of force by the police officers at all Therefore it remains to be determined whether the State authorities can be held responsible for having inflicted those injuries and held accountable under the above provisioneightyone  The Court notes that throughout the investigation the applicant consistently claimed that the authorities had used force against him The applicants account of events was corroborated by two witnesses NP and NiP questioned in the course of the investigation see also paragraph twentynine above However equally consistently all the police officers in question claimed the opposite They consistently stated that the applicant had had an injury to the back of his head from the outset that he had been involved in the fight and that they had not used any force against him see paragraphs  nine ten fourteen and thirtytwothirtyfour above This account of events was corroborated by witnesses AS AE and JK in their statements of seven August and seventeen October two thousand and twelve and fifteen January two thousand and thirteen In these circumstances it is clear that the whole set of events did not lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities While the medical report in respect of the applicant was produced a day after the events this is not sufficient for the Court to conclude certainly not beyond reasonable doubt that he was indeed illtreated in breach of Article three of the Convention see mutatis mutandis Habimi and Others v Serbia no nineteen thousand and seventytwoeight  eightynine three June two thousand and fourteen The second expert report carried out by the FMI stated that it had been impossible to identify the object that had caused the applicants injuries Moreover there were some indications to the effect that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused as a consequence of him and the other people being involved in the fight before the police intervention According to the prosecutors decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen the applicant had been hit by another man prior to the police intervention during the physical dispute The Court notes that the prosecutors decision stated that doubts had arisen as to whether the offence of abuse of power had been committed on the grounds that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused while he was being escorted to the police station by the RRF officers Nevertheless the Court notes that in his written observations the applicant did not submit any claim concerning any alleged illtreatment against him while being escorted by the police officers to the police station He strongly maintained that the police officers had beaten him in public in the main street of the city  In these circumstances the Court considers that it is not apparent that the applicant was still in good health when the authorities arrived at the scene see for instance Kobets v Ukraine no sixteen thousand four hundred and thirtysevenfour  fortysixfortyeight fourteen February two thousand and eighteightytwo  In such circumstances given all the information in its possession and in the light of the principles established by the Court in the recent case of Bouyid cited above where there was compelling evidence pointing to the fact that the applicants injuries had been caused by police officers as stated by that applicant see also Kulyk v Ukraine no thirty thousand seven hundred and sixtysix  eightythree twentythree June two thousand and sixteen the Court cannot but find that there has been no violation of the substantive aspect of Article three of the Conventiontwo  Alleged violation of the procedural aspect of Article three of the Conventiona  The parties submissionseightythree  The applicant submitted that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective and independent investigation into the incident They had failed to clarify how he had sustained wounds to the back of his head his back and shoulders No additional witnesses had been questioned and no material evidence such as hard objects had been examined by the authorities The authorities had failed to determine which officers were responsible and thus to identify and punish the perpetrators No medical aid had been given by the authorities and the applicant had been sent to hospital with the help of his family memberseightyfour  The applicant further submitted that the investigation had not been expeditious in that he had submitted a criminal complaint in August two thousand and twelve and the authorities had only informed him in June two thousand and thirteen that the investigation had been stayed Under Article three hundred and twentythree  one of the CCP a preliminary investigation should take no more than three months while in the present case the police officers had only been questioned five months after the incidenteightyfive  Moreover the applicant had not been involved in the investigation proceedings Indeed he had not been notified of the investigation being extended He had not been provided with copies of documents from the criminal investigation file in accordance with Article one hundred and five of the CCP The authorities having failed to inform him of actions taken in accordance with Articles fiftyeight and one hundred and five of the CCP had clearly denied him any effective remedy Furthermore the police officers had not been suspended from duty during the investigation Moreover according to the applicant under Article two hundred and fortyeight of the Criminal Code prosecution of the offence of abuse of power was timebarred after five years The delays allowed by the prosecution and the prosecutions decision to stay the investigation had enabled the perpetrators to avoid responsibilityeightysix  The Government submitted that the authorities had acted diligently and that an effective official investigation had taken place with the aim of punishing the perpetrators The authorities had accompanied the applicant to hospital so that he could receive medical aid following his complaints regarding the injuries he had sustained The investigation had been expeditious in that it had started within minutes of the incident taking placeeightyseven  The Government further submitted that the prosecutor and judicial police officers had taken several procedural measures During the criminal proceedings the applicant had not raised any complaint concerning any omission or refusal by the authorities to carry out any procedural action In circumstances where a possibility had existed that the applicant had made a false charge against the police officers and where it had also been impossible to identify the perpetrators the authorities had stayed the investigation but they had not discontinued the case Indeed the prosecutors decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen had ordered the performance of specific actions to identify the perpetrators Therefore the investigation had not yet been closedb  The Courts assessmenteightyeight  The Court refers to the general principles set out in inter alia ElMasri cited above  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive Mocanu and Others v Romania GC cited above nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts and Bouyid cited above  one hundred and fourteenone hundred and twentythreeeightynine  The Court reiterates that lack of conclusions arising from any given investigation does not by itself mean that it was ineffective Not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimants account of events however it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and if the allegations prove to be true to the identification and punishment of those responsible see Mikheyev v Russia no seventyseven thousand six hundred and seventeenone  one hundred and seven twentysix January two thousand and sixninety  The Court observes that following the applicants complaint the domestic authorities carried out an inquiry into his allegations of illtreatment A number of investigative steps were taken by the authorities witnesses were questioned register logs of the police station were examined the footage from the closed circuit video cameras of two nearby banks was obtained and examined and another forensic medical report was obtained The Court accepts that the authorities reacted to the complaints of the applicant however it is not convinced that their response to his allegations was sufficiently thorough or effective to meet the requirements of Article threeninetyone  More specifically the Court notes that the applicant in the present case was not provided with satisfactory updates on the status of the investigation or given any access to documents see paragraphs fortyfortythree above see Barysheva v Ukraine no nine thousand five hundred and fivetwelve  fiftyninesixtyone fourteen March two thousand and seventeen Therefore the Court considers the Governments allegation that the applicant did not complain about the authorities refusal to carry out any procedural action unfounded when the applicant did not have any real opportunity to do soninetytwo  The Court further notes that the proceedings were initially conducted with the required expediency However some of the essential investigative measures were taken inexplicably late In this connection the Court notes that although the applicant had complained to the authorities on the day of the incident six August two thousand and twelve and had also lodged a criminal complaint against the RRF police officers two days after the incident the police officers involved were only questioned by the prosecutor five months after the incident In this connection the Court reiterates that it has repeatedly underlined the importance of contacting and questioning witnesses in the immediate aftermath of such incidents when memories are fresh see for example Doiciu v Romania no one thousand four hundred and fiftyfournine  sixtytwo five May two thousand and fifteen Furthermore the second forensic medical report in the case was produced seven months after the incident see Dinu v Romania no sixtyfour thousand three hundred and fiftysixfourteen  eightytwo seven February two thousand and seventeenninetythree  The Court further notes that there were also other deficiencies The prosecuting authorities questioned two witnesses who testified in support of the applicant and six police officers and three witnesses who testified against him However the reasoning in the prosecutors decision to stay the investigation did not contain any assessment of the witness testimonies in favour of the applicant The prosecutor did not provide any explanation as to why those testimonies were considered less credible than the statements of the police officers and the three other witnesses see Mustafa Hajili v Azerbaijan no fortytwo thousand one hundred and nineteentwelve  fiftytwo twentyfour November two thousand and sixteen Despite the fact that their statements clearly conflicted with the applicants statement the prosecutor in charge of the case did not order a formal facetoface confrontation between the applicant and the police officers or even an identification parade even though the applicant explicitly asked for one see Chmil v Ukraine no twenty thousand eight hundred and sixten  eightynine twentynine October two thousand and fifteen and Hilal Mammadov v Azerbaijan no eightyone thousand five hundred and fiftythreetwelve  ninetysix four February two thousand and sixteenninetyfour  The Court also notes that the final decision in the case  the decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen to stay the investigation  does not provide any definite answer as to how the applicants injuries were inflicted Likewise it does not refute the possibility that the injuries in question could have resulted from police violence the prosecutor herself casting doubt on the cause of the applicants injuries without giving further reasons Furthermore in reply to the Governments submission that the investigation has not yet been completed the Court notes that even though more than four years have elapsed since the investigation was stayed the police authorities have not taken any other investigative steps since then The Government did not provide any document to report on the progress made by the police authorities in a further attempt to clarify the facts complained of by the applicant Therefore in view of the seriousness of the issues at stake the Court does not consider that the applicant should have waited for the outcome of any further investigation by the ICS as in any event the police authorities had not taken any further investigative measures since the staying of the proceedings by the district prosecutor on thirteen May two thousand and thirteen see mutatis mutandis Barakhoyev v Russia no eight thousand five hundred and sixteeneight  thirtyeight seventeen January two thousand and seventeenninetyfive  As regards an appeal under Article twentyfour of the CCP the Court notes that under the domestic law as in force at the relevant time a higherranking prosecutor had the right to overrule the decisions of a lowerranking prosecutor However the Court notes that the CCP did not provide for any right to appeal against a prosecutors decision staying a criminal investigation Furthermore in its decision of eighteen January two thousand and thirteen the Constitutional Court noted that there was no remedy under domestic law against a prosecutors decision staying an investigation Moreover under Article three hundred and twentysix of the CCP the investigation could only be reopened by a prosecutors decision In view of the above considerations and also noting that the Government did not submit any domestic caselaw the Court has serious doubts as to whether the domestic courts would indeed have admitted for examination an appeal by the applicant against the decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen Taking the abovementioned factors into consideration the Court considers that the remedy in issue would not have provided the applicant with any adequate redress for his grievancesninetysix  Lastly the Court notes the applicants complaint regarding the independence of the investigation The Court considers that it is not required to address this issue in the absence of any specific submission by the applicant and given that the investigation taken as a whole was ineffective owing to the deficiencies described aboveninetyseven  The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the investigation of the applicants claim of illtreatment was ineffective Therefore the Court dismisses the Governments preliminary objection regarding the nonexhaustion of domestic remedies and finds that the applicant has suffered a violation of the procedural aspect of Article three of the Conventionninetyeight  Having regard to its finding under Article three the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether there has also been a violation of Article thirteen of the Convention in this caseII  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTIONninetynine  In his application form the applicant also complained under Article three of the Convention that he had been threatened abused and illtreated while being escorted to the police station However the applicant did not submit any specific claim in his observations before the Courtone hundred  In view of all the information available in the case file and the lack of submissions by both parties the Court considers that there is no evidence that the applicant was indeed threatened or abused as alleged The applicants complaint is therefore manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionIII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and one  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or

statement written by his cellmate after March two thousand and seventeen a statement from a detainee written in two thousand and fifteen and a recent news report about the detention centretwentyseven  In November two thousand and sixteen the detention facility was visited by members of a public oversight committee They noted that the toilets consisting of a hole in the cells on the fourth floor were separated from the main area by a low partition or curtain and that it was not possible to switch the lights on or off from inside the cells They also noted that the detention centre had no courtyard for detaineestwo  The Governments accounttwentyeight  According to the Government as of February two thousand and seventeen the applicant was being held in cell no four hundred and three which measured twentysevenfour square metres not eighteen as submitted by the applicant The cell was equipped with a toilet a sink with hot and cold water beds and a table The main lights were switched off at night The detention centre had a library and detainees could borrow books Food was prepared and delivered by an external catering company Hot food was brought in special containersII  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAW AND PRACTICEtwentynine  In Ruling no fourteenP of twentythree May two thousand and seventeen the Russian Constitutional Court specified that the scope of the matter before it did not include the legality of imposing the penalty of administrative removal on a stateless person the related decision to confine that person to a special detention facility the legality of continued detention without specifying a timelimit or any legal consequences arising from the decision to discontinue such detention Instead the Constitutional Court focused on the constitutional requirement to have available an effective remedy against an unlawful unjustified or disproportionate deprivation of liberty Under Russian law there were two types of penalty of administrative removal the controlleddeparture procedure and the mandatoryremoval procedure The latter could be accompanied by a decision by the trial judge to issue an order with a view to enforcing the penalty that decision was enforceable immediately The use of such detention had to be in compliance with the requirements of proportionality be based on good reasons and correspond to the requirement of the reasonableness of legal regulations and practical application The Constitutional Court also pointed out that such detention was not automatic but remained at the discretion of the judge who had to find that it was necessary for ensuring the enforcement of the penalty of removal having due regard to all the pertinent circumstances The Constitutional Court then noted that it was indeed the case that under Russian law a trial judge was not required to put a timelimit on a detention order and that it was not excluded that such detention could continue after the expiry of the twoyear period for enforcement of the penalty A judge could not legally discontinue enforcement of a penalty where no country was ready to accept a defendant The absence of judicial review of detention contributed to the uncertainty which was present in the applicable legislative framework The Constitutional Court required the federal legislature to amend the CAO without delay by making provision for effective judicial reviewIII  OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALthirty  In May two thousand and sixteen the Russian authorities submitted a communication to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Action Plan DHDDtwo thousand and fifteenfive hundred and twentyseven relating to the execution of the Courts judgment in Kim v Russia no fortyfour thousand two hundred and sixtythirteen  fortyonefiftyseven and sixtyeightseventyfour seventeen July two thousand and fourteen As regards general measures the Russian authorities submitted that they were considering the necessity of legislative reform setting a timelimit for detention in centres for aliens pending removal As regards the violations of Article five  one and four of the Convention found in Kim cited above the Russian authorities indicated in Action Plan DHDDtwo thousand and seventeenfour hundred and twentyfive that the judgment had been translated published and disseminated to the competent authorities and that an assessment by them of the need for legislative reform was to take place by December two thousand and fifteen Following that assessment a report was submitted to the President of the Russian Federation in August two thousand and sixteen including proposals for legislative amendments As a result by an Order of twentysix October two thousand and sixteen the Government instructed the Ministry of the Interior to prepare a draft law On Amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences concerning detention with a view to expulsion and deportation as well as appeals The draft is due to be finalised by December two thousand and seventeenthirtyone  On twentysix May two thousand and sixteen the Human Rights Centre Memorial and the AntiDiscrimination Centre Memorial both NGOs submitted a communication DHDDtwo thousand and sixteeneight hundred and sixtyfour concerning the general measures in the Kim case They stated that in general the authorities were continuing the practice of the arbitrary detention of stateless individuals awaiting removal from the Russian Federation without making available a procedure for judicial review of the lawfulness of such a measure They noted however that a positive step had been taken by the courts in the city of Ivanovo by setting a timelimit for detention pending removal in some cases</td>\n",
       "      <td>I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTIONthirtytwo  The applicant complained under Article three of the Convention about the conditions of his detention in Krasnoye Selo Article three reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilitythirtythree  The Court observes at the outset that the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to five August two thousand and sixteen the date when he lodged his application with the Court as well as about the conditions of his continued detention after that date Having regard to the available information the parties submissions and the scope of the present case the Court considers it appropriate to examine the complaint as concerning the period from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen see for the approach albeit in the context of a continuous situation under Article five  three of the Convention Novokreshchin v Russia Committee no forty thousand five hundred and seventythreeeight  eleveneighteen twentyseven November two thousand and fourteen and Kalinin v Russia Committee no fiftyfour thousand seven hundred and fortyninetwelve  three and fifteen nineteen February two thousand and fifteen Both parties have been expressly afforded an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the entire period Indeed in their observations in February two thousand and seventeen as well as in their further observations the Government commented on the contemporaneous conditions of the applicants detention in cell no four hundred and six in which the applicant had been kept from January two thousand and seventeen until his release in June two thousand and seventeen It appears that the material conditions remained essentially the same during this final period of timethirtyfour  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsthirtyfive  The Court notes that the Governments submissions only concern the applicants conditions of detention which were contemporaneous with the Governments submission of their observations to the Court in February two thousand and seventeen After examining the applicants detailed submissions the other available material and in the absence of any submissions from the Government the Court considers it appropriate to rely on the applicants account of the material conditions of his detention as regards the period from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to twentyone January two thousand and seventeenthirtysix  The Court observes that the applicant did not allege that he had been kept at the relevant time in severely overcrowded conditions resulting for instance in him not having an individual sleeping place and having to take it in turns to sleep see by contrast Kim v Russia no fortyfour thousand two hundred and sixtythirteen  eighteennineteen and fortyonefiftyseven seventeen July two thousand and fourteen concerning the same detention facility in two thousand and thirteen and Georgia v Russia I GC no thirteen thousand two hundred and fiftyfiveseven  one hundred and ninetynine ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts It follows from the applicants own submissions that detainees had fourfourfive square metres of floor space each including space occupied by furniture but not the cell toilet area when he was detained with three other people in the cells located on the fourth floor of the detention centrethirtyseven  In the Courts view the above consideration is not by itself sufficient to conclude that there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention compare Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and sixtythreesixtyseven and one hundred and seventyseventyseven ECHR two thousand and sixteen extractsthirtyeight  As regards the other aspects see paragraphs twentytwentyfive above it is first noted that the toilet was separated from the main area by a partition and usually a curtain The available material including photographs submitted by the applicant does not disclose whether that arrangement raised any particular problem of privacy The applicant has also not specified in what manner the presence of bars on the windows posed a problem no particular consequences arose from that measure relating to the entry of natural light or air into the cell The allegation concerning mice was first raised in the applicants observations in reply to the Governments submissions It has not been argued that that was a pervasive problem at the material time or that the authorities did nothing to deal with itthirtynine  In so far as they have been substantiated and established in the present case the remaining aspects of the material conditions of confinement up to twentyone January two thousand and seventeen relating to the light in the cell during the night food hygiene and sanitary arrangements or activities in the detention centre were not shown to have reached the minimum threshold of severity and thus did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article three of the Convention Lastly nothing suggests that the applicant had any health issues that would require attention and could be pertinent in assessing the material conditions of confinementforty  As regards the conditions of the applicants detention from twentytwo January to twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen the Court discerns no significant factual elements to give a different assessmentfortyone  There has accordingly been no violation of Article three of the Convention as regards the conditions of the applicants detentionII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five  one OF THE CONVENTIONfortytwo  Referring to the Courts findings under Articles five and fortysix of the Convention in Kim cited above  fortyonefiftyseven and sixtyeightseventyfour the applicant complained that his detention had been and remained as of August two thousand and sixteen unlawful and arbitrary since it should have been clear to the authorities that his removal was impracticablefortythree  Article five  one of the Convention reads as followsone  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawf  the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extraditionfortyfour  The applicant submitted that it had been clear and had remained so all along that no State was willing to accept him and that he was a stateless person with no right of entry anywhere As early as two thousand and fifteen the Russian authorities had been told that the applicant had no right to enter or reside in Georgia However they had not attempted to negotiate with the Georgian authorities after that clarificationfortyfive  The Government argued that it had been possible to detain the applicant for two years which was the period for enforcing the final penalty of administrative removalfortysix  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissiblefortyseven  It is not disputed that the applicants detention in a centre for foreigners amounted to a deprivation of liberty and that it fell within the ambit of subparagraph f of Article five  one of the Convention The Court also notes that the applicant did not complain about his arrest and detention before or during the trial on fifteen December two thousand and fifteen Nor did he complain about his detention during the appeal proceedings which ended with the decision of twentysix January two thousand and sixteenfortyeight  There is no dispute about the fact that at all stages of the administrativeoffence proceedings the Russian authorities including the courts and the bailiff service were aware that the applicant was a stateless person The impracticability of his removal to Georgia should have become obvious to them no later than twentyfour March two thousand and sixteen when the Georgian authorities reiterated their earlier statement that the applicant was not a Georgian national and that there were no other legal grounds for assistance to the Russian authorities inter alia by way of providing documents for his entry into Georgia The Court has not been provided with sufficient information concerning any other plausible options for enforcing the penalty of removal in terms of arrangements for his removal such as reliance on a readmission procedure or agreement or in terms of a country of destination apart from removal to Georgia There is also no indication of the Russian authorities taking any steps towards the implementation of any such alternative solutionsfortynine  Having regard to the Courts findings in similar cases concerning the same legal framework see SK v Russia no fiftytwo thousand seven hundred and twentytwofifteen  one hundred and tenseventeen fourteen February two thousand and seventeen with further references and with particular regard to the context of the applicants situation as a stateless person the Court concludes that there have been violations of Article five  one of the Convention as regards the applicants detention counting at least from late March two thousand and sixteen to his release on twentytwo June two thousand and seventeenIII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five  four OF THE CONVENTIONfifty  The applicant complained under Article five  four of the Convention about the legal possibility to take proceedings to have the legality of and his continued detention reviewed by a court or have other pertinent aspects examined He also complained about the delay in the examination of his appeal against the judgment of fifteen December two thousand and fifteen in so far as it concerned his placement in a detention centre for foreignersfiftyone  Article five  four reads as followsfour  Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawfulA  The parties submissionsfiftytwo  The Government acknowledged that Article five  four had been violated on account of the length of the appeal proceedings in respect of the court decisions dated fifteen December two thousand and fifteen and twentysix January two thousand and sixteenfiftythree  The applicant maintained his complaint concerning the length of the appeal proceedings against the judgment of fifteen December two thousand and fifteen in so far as it concerned the detention matter He also maintained his complaint concerning the lack of a possibility to take proceedings for a review of his continued detention after January two thousand and sixteen As an example he referred to his case against the bailiff service in particular the fact that it had taken some three months to obtain an appeal decision see paragraph fifteen aboveB  The Courts assessmentfiftyfour  As regards the first complaint the Court notes that the relevant appeal decision was issued on twentysix January two thousand and sixteen while the related complaint about the length of the appeal proceedings in so far as it concerned the detention matter was first raised before the Court on five August two thousand and sixteen There is no reason to consider that the applicant or his lawyer were not immediately aware of that decision or that it is relevant to take into account for the purpose of applying the sixmonth rule the decision dated twentyfour June two thousand and sixteen taken in the review procedure under Article thirtytwelve of the CAO see also Smadikov v Russia dec no ten thousand eight hundred and tenfifteen thirtyone January two thousand and seventeen Accordingly this complaint has been lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  one and four of the Conventionfiftyfive  As regards the complaint about the absence of a review procedure in respect of the continued detention the Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissiblefiftysix  The Court has taken note of the findings in the ruling dated twentythree May two thousand and seventeen by the Constitutional Court in the applicants case However in terms of Article five  one and four of the Convention those findings have no direct bearing in respect of the assessments of the facts and procedure which mostly predated that ruling As to subsequent events the Court observes that on twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen a district court examined an application for release lodged on five June two thousand and seventeen and allowed it with reference to the constitutional rulingfiftyseven  Having regard to the Courts findings in similar cases see SK v Russia cited above  one hundred and fournine with further references the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article five  four of the ConventionIV  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damagefiftynine  The applicant claimed compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage leaving the amount to the Courts discretion He specified that as a stateless person he would be unable to open a bank account and thus requested that the Court authorise payment of any just satisfaction award into his representatives bank accountsixty  The Government made no specific commentsixtyone  The Court awards the applicant sevenfive hundred euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable Should it facilitate payment of that sum the Court considers it appropriate that the amount awarded to him by way of just satisfaction should be held in trust for him by his representative Ms O Tseytlina compare Khamidkariyev v Russia no fortytwo thousand three hundred and thirtytwofourteen  one hundred and seventyone twentysix January two thousand and seventeenB  Costs and expensessixtytwo  Ms Tseytlina also claimed on behalf of the applicant EUR oneone hundred for the costs and expenses incurred at the domestic level and EUR eight hundred and fifty for the representatives fees incurred before the Court She asked to have the award transferred to the bank account of the AntiDiscrimination Centre Memorial ADC Memorial a nongovernmental organisation in Belgiumsixtythree  The Government made no specific commentsixtyfour  According to the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum The Court observes that the legal services agreements concluded for proceedings at the domestic level and before the Court were signed by ADC Memorial and the applicants representative Ms Tseytlina Being one of the de facto beneficiaries of those agreements the applicant did not effect any payment and there is nothing to suggest that he incurred any pecuniary obligation under them Furthermore at least a part of the related expenses arguably incurred by ADC Memorial has not been shown to be related to the applicant and the violations of the Convention against him as found by the Court in the present case Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its caselaw the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR onezero under all heads to be paid to the AntiDiscrimination Centre Memorial

could not recommend his release  because only totally blind detainees are eligible The applicants detention is detrimental to his health his eyesight is deteriorating as each day goes by the light is always on in the cell day and night The light is dim that is bad for his eyesightThe members of the commission consider that the applicants detention  is a way to pressure him into giving the evidence

sufficient privacy In addition the applicant did not take a shower after his transfer to IZseventyseventwo until at least thirty July two thousand and thirteen as he indicated in his

       "      <td>I  JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONSseventy  Given their common factual and legal background the Court decides that the two applications should be joined pursuant to Rule fortytwo  one of the Rules of CourtII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION DURING PRETRIAL DETENTIONseventyone  The applicant submitted a number of complaints under Article three of the Convention referring to various aspects of his pretrial detention In particular he complained about the conditions of his detention in the remand prisons Next he alleged that he had not received adequate medical assistance while in detention Further he complained about the conditions of his transfer to and from court and the conditions of his detention in the convoy room at the Moscow City Court Article three of the Convention reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilityseventytwo  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds They must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone  Conditions of detention in the remand prisonsseventythree  The applicant alleged that the poor conditions of his detention in all remand prisons including those in the medical wing of IZseventysevenone had been in violation of Article three of the Convention The parties submissions as regards the material conditions of detention have been summarised in paragraphs thirtyfourthirtynine fortysevenfifty and fiftyfivefiftynine aboveseventyfour  The main facts relevant to the assessment of the conditions of detention in particular the size of the cells the number of inmates detained there concurrently with the applicant and the sanitary and hygiene arrangements were not in dispute between the parties Nevertheless they disagreed on whether those conditions had amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article three of the Convention The applicant maintained in particular that four square metres of personal space had been insufficient to avoid overcrowding in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventysevenone Furthermore he complained of inadequate ventilation and lighting of a lack of separation between the lavatory and the living space of limited access to drinking water and about the onehour limit on daily outdoor exercise in all the remand prisons He also contended that the cell in IZseventysevenone was cold The Government on the contrary contended that the applicants conditions of detention had been in conformity with the applicable standards for personal space light room temperature sanitary facilities and hygiene arrangementsseventyfive  The Court recently reiterated the general principles governing the application of Article three of the Convention to conditions of detention as well as the principles concerning prison overcrowding in Muršić v Croatia GC no seven thousand three hundred and thirtyfourthirteen  ninetysixone hundred and fortyone ECHR two thousand and sixteen In particular the Court confirmed that the requirement of three square metres of floor space per detainee in multioccupancy accommodation should be maintained as the relevant minimum standard for its assessment under Article three of the Convention ibid  one hundred and ten and one hundred and fourteen It also stated that a weighty but rebuttable presumption of a violation of Article three arose when personal space available to a detainee fell below three square metres That presumption could be refuted by demonstrating in particular that the cumulative effects of the other aspects of the conditions of detention compensated for the scarce allocation of personal space In that connection the Court takes into account such factors as the length and extent of the restriction the degree of freedom of movement and the adequacy of outofcell activities as well as whether or not the conditions of detention in the particular facility are generally decent ibid  one hundred and twentytwothirtyeightseventysix  In the present case the Court observes that in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventysevenone the applicant was held in cells that allowed him about four square metres of personal space which complies with the required standard On certain occasions in IZseventyseventwo the applicant was afforded personal space of twosix square metres The Court notes that this reduction in the required personal space was not especially long as it lasted from seven to twelve July two thousand and thirteen see for example Kurkowski v Poland no thirtysix thousand two hundred and twentyeightsix  sixtysixsixtyseven nine April two thousand and thirteen In addition the applicant was always provided with an individual bed he has never alleged that the arrangements of the cells such as fixtures like tables beds and toilets impeded him from moving freely within the cell see Vladimir Belyayev v Russia no nine thousand nine hundred and sixtysevensix  thirtyfour seventeen October two thousand and thirteen see also by contrast Manulin v Russia no twentysix thousand six hundred and seventysixsix  fortysix eleven April two thousand and thirteen and Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v Russia no fortyone thousand eight hundred and thirtythreefour  eightyseven twentyseven January two thousand and eleven Furthermore in IZseventyseventwo the applicant spent most of the day outside the cells participating in court hearings as the examination of his criminal case had already started by July two thousand and thirteenseventyseven  As regards other aspects of the physical conditions of detention in all the remand prisons the Court notes that the applicant was allowed a onehour period of outdoor exercise daily in IZ seventysevenfive he had access to a gym upon a written request Also each cell where the applicant was detained in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventyseventwo had unobstructed access to natural light The windows were not fitted with metal shutters or other devices preventing natural light from entering into the cell compare with Babushkin v Russia no sixtyseven thousand two hundred and fiftythreeone  fortyeight eighteen October two thousand and seven Where available a small window pane could be opened for fresh air and the cells provided sufficient artificial light and ventilation The temperature and humidity levels were within the appropriate limits in particular according to the measurement tables for IZseventysevenfive The lavatories in the cells were separated from the living space although the partition did not reach the ceiling contrast with Glotov v Russia no fortyone thousand five hundred and fiftyeightfive  twentyeight ten May two thousand and twelve It must be noted that the time for taking a shower limited to fifteen minutes a week has been considered as manifestly insufficient for maintaining proper bodily hygiene by the Court see Ananyev and Others v Russia nos fortytwo thousand five hundred and twentyfiveseven and sixty thousand eight hundredeight  one hundred and fiftyeight ten January two thousand and twelve with further references However the applicant did not complain about the other practical arrangements for showering such as a limited number of functioning showerheads or a lack of privacy due to the fact that inmates were taken to shower halls in groups ibid Finally the prison authorities regularly carried out the necessary pest control and disinfection measures They also provided detergent products for cleaning the cells on a daily basisseventyeight  Some elements in the applicants account of the conditions in the medical wing of IZseventysevenone were disputed by the Government in particular the allegations of insufficient light and cold in the cell The Court notes that the parties provided different descriptions of the size of the window see paragraphs fortyninefifty above It takes into account the evidential material produced by the Government that cell no seven hundred and seven had one window measuring one hundred and fifteen by one hundred and seventy cm Even though it had a metal grill with twentymm metal bars that arrangement could not significantly reduce the provision of natural light to the cell contrast Vlasov v Russia no seventyeight thousand one hundred and fortysixone  eightytwo twelve June two thousand and eight which was additionally lit with a fluorescent lamp with two fortywatt tubes The Court further notes that the applicant complained about the cell being cold which was also noted by the public commission for the monitoring of detention facilities see paragraph fiftytwo above However according to the certificate issued by the prison governor the temperature in the cell was maintained at eighteenoC which the Court has previously accepted as adequate see Khodorkovskiy v Russia no five thousand eight hundred and twentyninefour  one hundred and eleven thirtyone May two thousand and elevenseventynine  The Court acknowledges that the applicants conditions of detention in all the remand prisons fell short of the Minimum Standard Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners the European Prison Rules and the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture in some aspects These include in particular infrequent hot showers restricted outofcell activities and limited access to drinking water The Court also notes in that regard the report issued by the public commission for the monitoring of detention facilities which noted a broken pane of glass the lack of a fridge or television a broken radio socket and dirty scuffed walls in the cell in IZseventysevenone see paragraph fiftytwo above Nevertheless taking into account the cumulative effect of these conditions and the fact that the applicant was only detained in IZseventysevenone for a month and a half the Court does not consider that the conditions of his detention reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article three of the Convention see for similar reasoning Yaroslav Belousov cited above  ninetyeight Fetisov and Others v  Russia nos fortythree thousand seven hundred and tenseven and three others  one hundred and thirtyseventhirtyeight seventeen January two thousand and twelve and compare Vladimir Belyayev cited above  thirtysix As regards the reduction in the minimum required personal space in IZseventyseventwo the Court stresses its reasonably short duration the fact that the applicant spent most of the day outside the cell and the general adequacy of the conditions of detention in that facility The Court finds that those factors are capable of rebutting the strong presumption of a violation of Article three of the Conventioneighty  The Court therefore concludes that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention in respect of the conditions of detention in any of the remand prisonstwo  Alleged failure to provide adequate medical assistanceeightyone  The applicant alleged that his eyesight had seriously deteriorated during his detention and that he had not received any treatment for that problem He relied on the medical report of sixteen October two thousand and twelve as proof that his myopia had worsened The Government disagreed with the applicant and argued that he had been regularly examined by medical specialists including ophthalmologists and had been provided with the requisite treatment They pointed out that from seventeen September two thousand and twelve to four November two thousand and twelve the applicant had undergone an inpatient examination in the prison medical wing and that in two thousand and twelve he had had three consultations with an ophthalmologist at a specialist ophthalmology clinic He had also undergone a special examination but it had not led to him being given any disability statuseightytwo  The Court reiterates that even though Article three does not entitle a detainee to be released on compassionate grounds it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and wellbeing of detainees among other things as an obligation on the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance see Kudła v Poland GC no thirty thousand two hundred and tenninetysix  ninetyfour ECHR two thousandXI Kalashnikov v Russia no fortyseven thousand and ninetyfiveninetynine  ninetyfive ECHR two thousand and twoVI and Khudobin v Russia no fiftynine thousand six hundred and ninetysixzero  ninetysix ECHR two thousand and sixXII extracts The adequacy of medical assistance remains the most difficult element to determine The Court insists that in particular authorities must ensure that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate see Khatayev v Russia no fiftysix thousand nine hundred and ninetyfournine  eightyfive eleven October two thousand and eleven Yevgeniy Alekseyenko cited above  one hundred Gladkiy v Russia no three thousand two hundred and fortytwothree  eightyfour twentyone December two thousand and ten Hummatov v Azerbaijan nos nine thousand eight hundred and fiftytwothree and thirteen thousand four hundred and thirteenfour  one hundred and fifteen twentynine November two thousand and seven and mutatis mutandis Holomiov v Moldova no thirty thousand six hundred and fortyninefive  one hundred and twentyone seven November two thousand and six and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainees health problems or preventing their aggravation see Hummatov cited above  one hundred and nine and one hundred and fourteen Popov v Russia no twentysix thousand eight hundred and fiftythreefour  two hundred and eleven thirteen July two thousand and six and Sarban v Moldova no three thousand four hundred and fiftysixfive  seventynine four October two thousand and fiveeightythree  On the whole the Court reserves sufficient flexibility in defining the required standard of health care deciding it on a casebycase basis That standard should be compatible with the human dignity of a detainee but should also take into account the practical demands of imprisonment see Aleksanyan v Russia no fortysix thousand four hundred and sixtyeightsix  one hundred and forty twentytwo December two thousand and eighteightyfour  In the present case the applicant argued that no action had been taken by the authorities in spite of his rapidly deteriorating eyesight The Court notes however that the predetention diagnosis of the applicants myopia dated back to two thousand and four eight years prior to his detention see the medical report of sixteen October two thousand and twelve cited in paragraph fiftyone above In the absence of any information about his diagnosis immediately before his arrest it is impossible to establish that the progress of his myopia from medium to high was attributable specifically to the period in detention The Court has examined the applicants medical files submitted by the Government and has found that following his complaints he was given a comprehensive medical examination and was taken to an ophthalmologist on at least three occasions None of the medical reports drawn up after those consultations indicate any threat to the applicants eyesight or the need for further tests or treatment There is nothing in the case file to cast doubt on those reports Furthermore the applicant did not argue that he had not been prescribed or provided with correctional glasses or contact lenses appropriate to his degree of myopia According to the last examination in the remand prison the only recommendation he received was to have regular consultations with an ophthalmologist see paragraph sixtyone above The Court therefore finds no reason to believe that the Russian authorities failed to provide the applicant with adequate medical assistanceeightyfive  In view of the above the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention in this respectthree  Conditions of transfer to and from courteightysix  The applicant alleged that his transfers from the remand prisons to court and back had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment He complained about the frequency and the length of those transfers of appalling conditions at the prison assembly sections and in the police vans and about the intensity of the schedule which did not leave him sufficient time to sleep The applicant argued that the combination of the above factors had led to physical exhaustion and mental distresseightyseven  The Court examined the conditions of transfer to and from court which were common to the applicant and his codefendants in the case of Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and threeeleven It found that those conditions amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article three of the Convention on account of a lack of sufficient rest and sleep on the days of court hearings overcrowding and generally poor conditions in the prison assembly sections and convoy cells at the Moscow City Court lengthy transfers between the remand prisons and the court and poor conditions during the transfers The Court sees no reason to depart from those findings in the present case Accordingly there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention in that respectIII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF CONFINEMENT IN GLASS CABINS AND METAL CAGES DURING COURT HEARINGSeightyeight  The applicant complained that his confinement in glass cabins and metal cages during court hearings had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment He relied on Article three of the Conventioneightynine  The Government contended that placing defendants behind metal barriers in courtrooms was a technical measure aimed at ensuring the security of all detainees The applicant and his codefendants had been kept in the same if not better conditions while in court as any other detained defendant in criminal proceedingsA  Admissibilityninety  The Government submitted that the applicants complaints about his confinement in glass cabins had been lodged out of time They repeated their submissions made in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and thirteen in that regardninetyone  The Court observes that the Government did not raise the issue of the applicants compliance with the sixmonth rule as regards his confinement in metal cages It has previously found that the application of that rule should not be set aside solely because a Government have not made a preliminary objection based on it see Sabri Güneş v Turkey GC no twentyseven thousand three hundred and ninetysixsix  twentynine twentynine June two thousand and twelve and Walker v the United Kingdom dec no thirtyfour thousand nine hundred and seventynineninetyseven ECHR two thousandI The Court therefore considers it appropriate to address this issue in the present caseninetytwo  The Court reiterates that the applicants confinement in glass cabins and metal cages concerned two distinct periods with materially different conditions of detention which cannot be regarded as a continuous situation for the purposes of calculating the sixmonth timelimit set forth in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and fourteen Furthermore the Court has previously accepted that no remedy was available to applicants in relation to courtroom arrangements and that the sixmonth timelimit should be calculated from the date the alleged illtreatment ceased see Svinarenko and Slyadnev v Russia GC nos thirtytwo thousand five hundred and fortyoneeight and fortythree thousand four hundred and fortyoneeight  eightyseven ECHR two thousand and fourteen extractsninetythree  Turning to the present case the Court notes that the alleged illtreatment took place during the firstinstance hearing which finished on nineteen December two thousand and thirteen owing to the termination of criminal proceedings against the applicant The Court further notes that the alleged illtreatment by placement in glass cabins began on six June two thousand and thirteen and ended on an unidentified date in the middle of September two thousand and thirteen when the proceedings moved to the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow see paragraph sixtythree above The applicant lodged his complaint in that regard on thirty July two thousand and thirteen while he was still being placed in glass cabins The complaint about the confinement in metal cages was not lodged until twentythree March two thousand and fifteen as part of the applicants submissions in reply to the Governments observations on application no fifty thousand and fortyonefourteen that is more than six months after the termination of criminal proceedings against the applicantninetyfour  The applicant has not submitted that there existed any exceptional circumstances preventing him from complying with the six months rule The Court therefore considers that the complaint under Article three of the Convention about being placed in metal cages was lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  one and four of the Conventionninetyfive  In contrast the Court finds that the applicant has complied with the six months rule as regards the complaint about being placed in glass cabins It notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsninetysix  The Court summarised the principles on confinement in glass cabins in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and twentytwentytwo It has examined the conditions of detention in hearing rooms nos three hundred and thirtyeight and six hundred and thirtyfive at the Moscow City Court which were common to the applicant and his codefendants including Mr Belousov ibid  one hundred and twentythreetwentyeight and found a violation in respect of issues identical to those in the present case Having examined all the material submitted to it the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion Accordingly there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention on account of the conditions of detention in hearing room no three hundred and thirtyeight at the Moscow City Court but no violation of Article three as regards the conditions of detention in hearing room no six hundred and thirtyfiveIV  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five OF THE CONVENTIONninetyseven  The applicant complained under Article five  one of the Convention that his pretrial detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence He also complained that his pretrial detention had not been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons as required by Article five  three of the Convention Article five of the Convention in so far as relevant reads as followsone  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law c  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so three  Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph one c of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trialA  Admissibilityninetyeight  As regards the alleged unlawfulness of the applicants detention the Court notes that it was the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow which ordered that measure and that the same court subsequently extended it on several occasions After the case had been sent for trial the detention order was issued by the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow The domestic courts acted within their powers in making those decisions and there is nothing to suggest that they were invalid or unlawful under domestic law Accordingly the applicants detention was imposed and extended in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawninetynine  As regards the allegation that the applicants detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed criminal offences his complaint under Article five  one of the Convention overlaps to a large extent with his complaint under Article five  three about the authorities failure to adduce relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the extensions of his detention pending criminal proceedings The Court reiterates that while Article five  one c of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings Article five  three of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention Moreover according to the Courts established caselaw under the latter provision the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention see Buzadji v the Republic of Moldova GC no twentythree thousand seven hundred and fiftyfiveseven  eightyseven ECHR two thousand and sixteen extracts The Court therefore deems it more appropriate to deal with this complaint under Article five  three of the Convention see Kovyazin and Others v Russia nos thirteen thousand and eightthirteen and two others  seventyone seventeen September two thousand and fifteen Taranenko v Russia no nineteen thousand five hundred and fiftyfourfive  fortysix fifteen May two thousand and fourteen and Khodorkovskiy cited above  one hundred and sixtyfiveone hundred  Furthermore the Court finds that the applicants complaint of a violation of Article five  three is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that this part of the application is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone hundred and one  The parties made essentially the same submissions under Article five of the Convention as in Kovyazin and Others cited above  seventythreeseventyfour The relevant general principles applicable in this case were summarised by the Court in that judgment ibid  seventyfiveseventyeightone hundred and two  The period of detention to be taken into consideration in this case started on ten June two thousand and twelve the date of the applicants arrest and ended on nineteen December two thousand and thirteen when he was released following the application of the Amnesty Act Accordingly the period to be taken into consideration is one year and six months The Court also notes that the criminal trial in the applicants case began on eighteen June two thousand and thirteen which is one year after his arrest Having regard to the considerable length of detention in the light of the presumption in favour of release the Court finds that the Russian authorities were required to put forward very weighty reasons for maintaining that measure against the applicantone hundred and three  It follows from the applicants detention orders and the Governments observations that the primary reason for his continuous detention was the gravity of the charges Firstly the domestic courts considered that the applicant faced with the risk of prison was likely to abscond influence witnesses or interfere with the administration of justice Secondly they seemed to suggest that the very nature of the offences in question together with information about the applicants character made it likely that he would reoffend and obstruct the course of the criminal proceedingsone hundred and four  The Court has previously examined similar complaints lodged by the applicants codefendants and found a violation of their rights set out in Article five  three of the Convention see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and thirtythreethirtyeight and Kovyazin and Others cited above  eightytwoninetyfour The Court noted in particular the domestic courts reliance on the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the potential to abscond reoffend or obstruct the course of justice and their reluctance to pay proper attention to a discussion of each applicants personal situation or to have proper regard to factors pointing in favour of release It also noted the use of collective detention orders without a casebycase assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each codefendant and the failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying a less rigid measure of restraint such as bailone hundred and five  Having regard to the material in its possession the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case Indeed the specific offence imputed to the applicant  shouting political slogans and throwing a flagpole which hit a police officer but caused no lasting harm  may have initially warranted his pretrial detention However with the passage of time the nature and the seriousness of the offence as grounds for the applicants continued detention inevitably became less and less relevant see Kovyazin and Others cited above  eightyfive and Artemov v Russia no fourteen thousand nine hundred and fortyfivethree  seventyfive three April two thousand and fourteen The Court further notes that the applicants detention was extended by the same collective orders as those of his codefendants without any individual assessment of his situation Kovyazin and Others cited above  ninetytwoninetythree In addition the domestic courts dismissed the applicants requests for an alternative preventive measure without even considering the guarantees signed by parliamentary deputies a wellknown writer and the directors of prominent NGOs agreeing to vouch for him see paragraphs fifteensixteen eighteen and twentyone aboveone hundred and six  There has accordingly been a violation of Article five  three of the ConventionV  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES ten AND eleven OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and seven  The applicant alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly He complained in particular of disruptive security measures at the site of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square and argued that his pretrial detention and prosecution for participation in acts of mass disorder had not been necessary in a democratic society He relied on Articles ten and eleven of the Convention which read as followsArticle tenone  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprisestwo  The exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciaryArticle elevenone  Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his intereststwo  No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces of the police or of the administration of the Stateone hundred and eight  The Governments submissions on the admissibility and the merits of the case were identical to those in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  fifteen thousand six hundred and fiftyseven and one hundred and sixtysixtythreeone hundred and nine  The applicant submitted that on six May two thousand and twelve he went to take part in a peaceful meeting which had been authorised by the Moscow authorities He alleged that the episodes of disorderly behaviour and the clashes between the protesters and the police had been caused or compounded by the authorities crowdcontrol measures The applicant insisted that he was a peaceful lawabiding individual who had not planned to take part in acts of mass disorder He had never pleaded guilty to the offence he had been charged with and had only agreed to terminate the criminal proceedings against him following the Amnesty Act because his eyesight had been deteriorating In the applicants view his ensuing prosecution and the severity of the charges against him had had the aim of discouraging him other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrationsone hundred and ten  The Court notes that while the criminal proceedings in question were still pending at the time when the applicant lodged the first application they were subsequently terminated following the Amnesty Act It reiterates in this connection that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim unless the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the Convention see Öztürk v Turkey GC no twentytwo thousand four hundred and seventynineninetythree  seventythree ECHR one thousand nine hundred and ninetynineVI In the instant case the applicant was not entitled under the domestic law to compensation for damages or the restitution of various rights for the measures against him see paragraph sixtynine above Nor did the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court in its decision of nineteen December two thousand and thirteen acknowledge the alleged breach of the applicants right to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly owing to those measures see paragraph thirtytwo above The applicant may not therefore be considered to have lost his victim status on account of the termination of the criminal proceedings against him following the application of the Amnesty Act see mutatis mutandis Gülcü v Turkey no seventeen thousand five hundred and twentysixten  ninetynineone hundred nineteen January two thousand and sixteenone hundred and eleven  On the other hand regard being had to the essence of the applicants complaints the Court will examine whether despite the termination of the criminal proceedings he could still demonstrate that his pretrial detention and prosecution for a criminal offence amounted to an interference with the exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly It notes that criminal proceedings not culminating in a criminal conviction may depending on the circumstances amount to an interference with those rights see Döner and Others v Turkey no twentynine thousand nine hundred and ninetyfourtwo  eightynine seven March two thousand and seventeenone hundred and twelve  The Court observes that the applicant was not convicted of the criminal offence of mass disorder unlike those of his codefendants who were ineligible to be amnestied see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and seventyseven Therefore the detrimental consequences of his prosecution as presented by the applicant were limited to those which were connected with his pretrial detention The Court has found above that his detention for one year and six months was not justified under Article five  three of the Convention see paragraphs one hundred and twoone hundred and six above and that that preventive measure was associated with prison transfers and courtroom arrangements which constituted treatment contrary to Article three see paragraphs eightyseven and ninetysix aboveone hundred and thirteen  In examining whether the same facts also gave rise to an interference with the applicants rights under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention the Court notes the applicants allegation that the excessively long pretrial detention and the severity of the charges were intended to discourage him and other opposition supporters from attending demonstrations and participating in political debate However unlike in the case of the applicants convicted codefendant Mr Belousov the Court does not find sufficient grounds to accept that allegation Mr Belousov was charged under Article two hundred and twelve of the Criminal Code of mass disorder which consisted of staying at the site of the rally and chanting antigovernment slogans in addition to a separate charge of violent acts against police officers under Article three hundred and eighteen of the Criminal Code In that case the Court found that acts which were peaceful had accounted for a striking oneandahalfyear addition to the applicants prison term see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  seventeen thousand seven hundred and seventyeightone hundred and fourteen  In the present case by contrast the charges of mass disorder under Article two hundred and twelve of the Criminal Code covered both the peaceful and violent acts imputed to the applicant namely chanting antigovernment slogans and throwing a flagpole at the police The judicial proceedings did not establish whether the applicant had indeed committed those acts because his prosecution was terminated before the end of the trial The essential details relating to his conduct at the site of the rally remained unclear and no assessment was given of the degree of violence in the impugned acts or the possible role of the applicant in the initial acts of aggression which led to the disruption of the public event Consequently the applicant has not demonstrated that the crowdcontrol measures complained of or the ensuing criminal charges related to the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly or to the political message expressed thereby Accordingly there are no grounds to conclude that the measures constituted an interference with the rights to freedom of expression or to freedom of peaceful assemblyone hundred and fifteen  It follows that the complaints under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention must be rejected as manifestly illfounded pursuant to Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionVI  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE eighteen OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and sixteen  The applicant complained under Article eighteen of the Convention that the criminal proceedings against him had pursued the aim of undermining his right to freedom of assembly The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article eighteen in conjunction with Article eleven of the Convention Article eighteen of the Convention reads as followsThe restrictions permitted under the Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribedone hundred and seventeen  In their submissions under this head the parties reiterated their arguments as regards the alleged interference with the right to freedom of assemblyone hundred and eighteen  The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the complaints examined above under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention Having regard to its findings in paragraphs one hundred and tenone hundred and fifteen the Court considers that that this part of the application is also manifestly illfounded and must be rejected pursuant to Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionVII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and nineteen  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damageone hundred and twenty  The applicant claimed oneone hundredzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damageone hundred and twentyone  The Government contested the claim as unreasonable and excessiveone hundred and twentytwo  The Court observes that it has found violations of Articles three and five of the Convention in respect of the applicant In those circumstances the Court considers that the applicants suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation Making its assessment on an equitable basis it awards the applicant EUR tenzero in respect of nonpecuniary damageB  Costs and expensesone

         THE FACTS  \\\n",
       "0  I  THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASEfour  The applicant was born in one thousand nine hundred and eightyseven and is detained in Tiszalökfive  On nineteen July two thousand and twelve at approximately nine am the applicant who had been placed in pretrial detention in Budapest Prison was transported to the premises of the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning He was accompanied by two guards and was handed over for questioning at around ninetwenty am when he showed no sign of injuriessix  The questioning started at approximately ninefiftyfive am and lasted until approximately eleventhirty am It was conducted by police officers A and B The applicant chose not to give a statementseven  On being released after the interrogation the applicant was handed over to the guards of Budapest Prison who in the presence of the police officer asked him whether he had been illtreated The applicant declared that he had not beeneight  After being transported back to Budapest Prison the applicant underwent a medical examination before his readmission during which he claimed that he had been illtreated by police officer A Certain injuries were noted on the applicant A report was drawn up on the incident and photos were taken of the injuriesnine  Right after the medical examination the applicant was again transported to the Budapest Main Police Department for questioning from where he was taken to the military hospital by the police officer conducting his interrogation and allegedly assaulting him At the hospital he was examined in the presence of the police officer The medical report noted bleeding on the lower lip jaw sensitive to pressure and bruises on the ribs all likely to heal within eight daysten  According to the applicants submission following his return to Budapest Prison he was again subjected to a medical examinationeleven  The police report filed by A on nineteen July two thousand and twelve stated that the applicant had not been illtreated during questioning None of the police officers had seen the applicant harming himself but A had observed him biting his nails and lips Also according to the report the applicant had been left alone for a few minutes at the police station without constant surveillancetwelve  On twenty July two thousand and twelve the applicant complained of a headache and dizziness and was again examined by medical staff at Budapest Prison He asserted that he had been illtreated during his interrogation The medical report recorded the following injuries swelling on the right cheek head sensitive to pressure bruising on the lower lip and abrasions on the lower right ribs and on the left shoulder bladethirteen  Budapest Prison initiated criminal proceedings on charges of forced interrogation Furthermore the applicants statements given during the medical examination see paragraph eight above were qualified as a criminal complaint by the investigation authoritiesfourteen  In the ensuing criminal investigation conducted by the Central Investigation Office the applicant gave a testimony on fourteen November two thousand and twelve stating that during his questioning he had refused to make a statement and as a consequence had been punched by one of the police officers several times on his head neck and back He had fallen against a chair and when he had tried to get up he had been slapped four or five times in the face He had been shown the results of a DNA test and when he refused to comment on it had again been beaten by the police officer The same police officer had also punched him in the mouth when he had failed to recognise a person shown to him in a photograph He had been pushed against the door and when he again fell over the police officer had kicked him on his left sidefifteen  On twentyfour July two thousand and thirteen one of the prisoner escort officers C was questioned and recalled that the applicant had complained of illtreatment upon his return to the prison facility which had surprised him since he had previously asked the applicant whether he had any complaints and had seen no injuries on the applicants body He also stated that he had noted the injuries on the applicants face following the medical examination at Budapest Prison He had asked the applicant why he had not complained of his illtreatment earlier to which the applicant had replied that he had been afraid of the police officers According to C as a general practice detainees had been transferred in a special prisoner transport vehicle where they had not been constantly monitored and would have had the opportunity to inflict injuries on themselvessixteen  On twentyfive July two thousand and thirteen D the other prisoner escort officer who accompanied the applicant to his interrogation was also heard as a witness He did not remember either the applicant or the circumstances of his transfer He had a vague recollection that since there had been some complaints from the applicants side once they had arrived back at the prison facility they had had to transfer him back to the police department He maintained that if they had seen any injury on the applicants face following interrogation they would surely have inquired of him whether he had been illtreated by the police officers Therefore in his estimation the applicant could not have shown any visible signs of injury when he was handed back from the interrogationseventeen  On six October two thousand and thirteen E the prison security officer who had taken photos of the applicants injuries during his readmission was questioned as a witness He could not give any details of the incident He could not remember whether he had escorted the applicant to the medical examination but suggested that the applicants injuries must have occurred before he had been examined by the medical staff which was why he had been called on to take photoseighteen  On eighteen November two thousand and thirteen F the nurse on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned but she did not remember the incident She could only confirm that if she had seen the applicants injuries prior to his transfer she would surely have inquired about their origin Examining the photos of the applicant she asserted that the bruises on the applicants face would have occurred immediately after an impact and that the applicant could have caused them himselfnineteen  On five December two thousand and thirteen G the guard on duty at Budapest Prison was questioned as a witness he could not remember either the applicant or anything else concerning his complaint He nonetheless maintained that if he had seen injuries on the applicant as presented to him on a photo he would surely have inquired about their origintwenty  On two January two thousand and fourteen the Central Investigation Office also heard evidence from H and I two prison escort officers from Budapest Prison who had been on duty on the day of the incident and who were responsible for transferring detainees to the healthcare facilities They did not remember the applicant and could not recall the circumstances of his medical examination or admission to the prison since as one of them explained they were responsible for escorting thirty to forty prisoners a day H stated that as a general practice detainees were under constant supervision while waiting for medical examinations whereas I asserted that there were instances where detainees were left alone when placed in socalled healthcare waiting rooms Neither of the witnesses knew with certainty whether this had been the case for the applicanttwentyone  On the same day three members of the medical staff of Budapest Prison were also heard as witnesses Two of them could not recall anything about the incident and did not remember the applicant mostly because they were responsible for a large number of cases Another member of the healthcare staff stated that she had a recollection of an incident but was not sure whether it involved the applicant or another person As a general rule the witnesses explained that they would not admit a detainee into the prison if he showed signs of injuries Examining the photos of the applicant two of the medical staff stated that because of the bad quality of the photos they werent even sure if they showed actual injuries or simply the shape of the applicants face while the third asserted that the injury must have been fresh when the photo was takentwentytwo  The prison doctor was also questioned the same day She could not identify the applicant did not remember whether she had met him had no recollection of the incident and could only recount what she had previously stated in the medical report However she stated that if the applicant had been left alone he could have inflicted the injuries on himselftwentythree  The Central Investigation Office commissioned a forensic expert opinion According to the expert assessment the applicants account of the origins of his injuries was implausible since if he had been illtreated in the way described by him his injuries would have been of a more serious nature Furthermore the location of the injuries had not corresponded to the applicants description of the incident either The report stated that it was impossible to establish when the applicants injuries had occurred Referring to the witness testimonies and the location of the injuries it suggested that the applicant could have inflicted them on himselftwentyfour  The investigation was discontinued on eight May two thousand and fourteen on the grounds that the applicants allegations could not be substantiated beyond doubt in the absence of any witness testimony and taking into account the conclusions of the forensic expert opinion According to the reasoning the available evidence neither refuted nor proved the applicants allegations The applicant complained seeking the continuation of the investigations The firstinstance decision was upheld by the Chief Prosecutors Office on fifteen July two thousand and fourteen The decision called the applicants attention to the possibility of lodging of initiating substitute private prosecution proceedingsII  RELEVANT DOMESTIC LAWtwentyfive  The relevant domestic law is set out in Borbála Kiss v Hungary no fiftynine thousand

that had been given by the applicant and the other people who had either been involved in or had witnessed the brawl on six August two thousand and twelve In so far as relevant the decision stated the followingJK gave information about the event stating that Petri Pihoni had been involved in the dispute having been informed about it by telephone by NP  Petri had struck A who had hit back in response  the police officers had escorted AS NP and Petri to the police station JK saw that both NP and Petri resisted the police officers by declining to get into the police vehicle  JK confirmed that the officers actions were correct  none of them touched or used force against them AS NP and the applicantAE was questioned in relation to the events He runs a private business close to the site His statement indicates that a physical dispute was taking place between three people All the people were having a fight by the time an RRF police car arrived The police officers called on those people to stop fighting but they continued to have a fist fight until the officers intervened pulled them by their arms and got them into the police vehicle AE stated that he had not seen any officers using rubber truncheonsDrawing on the facts and evidence collected during the course of the investigation in respect of criminal file no  three hundred and three the result is that we are not confronted with the criminal offence of the commission of arbitrary actions as provided for by Article two hundred and fifty of the Criminal Code In the instant case it was proved that Petri Pihoni was involved in a physical argument with some people Despite his own statements the statements given by AS JK and AE indicate that NP called Petri who appeared at the scene and became involved in a debate about the sum that NP owed AS The debate escalated into a physical dispute in which Petri struck AS who hit back in responseIn such circumstances the RRF officers witnessed a violent dispute and took the three people to the police station with a view to their giving explanations about its causesI consider that the officers actions  are in compliance with sections four ninetytwo ninetyfive and ninetysix of the State Police Act and cannot be classified as arbitrary actions which affect the freedom of citizensAs regards the criminal complaint that physical violence was used by the RRF officers when Petri was taken to the police station I consider that doubts arise as to whether the offence of abuse of power as provided for by Article two hundred and fortyeight of the CC has been committed This is the case given the injuries sustained by Petri which may have been caused while he was escorted to the police station by RRF officers During the investigation Petri Pihoni was questioned on several occasions as to whether he could identify the RRF officers who might have struck him He responded that he was unable to proceed with the identification procedure because the blows had come from behind and he was unable to identify the officer who had struck the blowsThe remaining evidence obtained during the investigation does not shed any light on this incident Having regard to the fact that criminal responsibility is individual and not collective I consider that the investigation should be stayedB  The applicants requests for informationforty  Having not received

before it did not include the legality of imposing the penalty of administrative removal on a stateless person the related decision to confine that person to a special detention facility the legality of continued detention without specifying a timelimit or any legal consequences arising from the decision to discontinue such detention Instead the Constitutional Court focused on the constitutional requirement to have available an effective remedy against an unlawful unjustified or disproportionate deprivation of liberty Under Russian law there were two types of penalty of administrative removal the controlleddeparture procedure and the mandatoryremoval procedure The latter could be accompanied by a decision by the trial judge to issue an order with a view to enforcing the penalty that decision was enforceable immediately The use of such detention had to be in compliance with the requirements of proportionality be based on good reasons and correspond to the requirement of the reasonableness of legal regulations and practical application The Constitutional Court also pointed out that such detention was not automatic but remained at the discretion of the judge who had to find that it was necessary for ensuring the enforcement of the penalty of removal having due regard to all the pertinent circumstances The Constitutional Court then noted that it was indeed the case that under Russian law a trial judge was not required to put a timelimit on a detention order and that it was not excluded that such detention could continue after the expiry of the twoyear period for enforcement of the penalty A judge could not legally discontinue enforcement of a penalty where no country was ready to accept a defendant The absence of judicial review of detention contributed to the uncertainty which was present in the applicable legislative framework The Constitutional Court required the federal legislature to amend the CAO without delay by making provision for effective judicial reviewIII  OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALthirty  In May two thousand and sixteen the Russian authorities submitted a communication to the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers Action Plan DHDDtwo

       "0  I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTIONtwentysix  The applicant complained that he had been illtreated by the police and that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective investigation into the illtreatment in breach of Article three of the Convention which providesNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilityone  The parties submissionsa  The Governmenttwentyseven  The Government first objected that the application was inadmissible for failure to exhaust domestic remedies They submitted that the applicant should have pursued substitute private prosecution proceedings which could have remedied the alleged violation of the States procedural obligations  and in particular the obligation incumbent on the prosecution authorities to take the necessary steps to establish the criminal responsibility of alleged perpetrators They added that if the applicants motion for private prosecution proceedings had been dismissed by the firstinstance court he could have either appealed against this decision or lodged a constitutional complainttwentyeight  The Government also submitted that the Courts findings in Borbála Kiss v Hungary cited above  twentyfivetwentysix and Gubacsi v Hungary no fortyfour thousand six hundred and eightysixseven  thirtyonethirtytwo twentyeight June two thousand and eleven were not applicable in the present case since in those cases the reason for dismissing the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies had been the apparent legal uncertainty concerning substitute private prosecution proceedings The Government further suggested that the Court should take the same approach as it had in the case of Horváth and Vadászi v Hungary dec no two thousand three hundred and fiftyonesix nine November two thousand and ten which was declared inadmissible for nonexhaustion of domestic remediestwentynine  The Government also argued that the admittedly low success rate of substitute private prosecution proceedings did not mean that this procedure was inefficient since the dismissal of such applications was mainly due to noncompliance with the relevant formal requirementsb  The applicantthirty  The applicant for his part submitted that the Government had not produced any evidence to show that substitute private prosecution proceedings had been an effective remedy in cases similar to his and would therefore constitute a remedy to be exhausted in the circumstances He argued that he had sought redress through the available national channels by lodging a criminal complaint The mere fact that his attention had been drawn to the possibility of acting as a substitute private prosecutor had not in itself rendered this legal avenue an effective remedy to be exhausted He lodged a criminal complaint by which the responsibility to pursue the prosecution of officers accused of illtreatment lay with the public prosecutor and there was no reason to require him to have pursued the prosecution of the accused officers of his own motiontwo  The Courts assessmentthirtyone  The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention obliges applicants to use first the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for alleged breaches alleged to have taken place see Pyrantienė v Lithuania no fortyfive thousand and ninetytwoseven  twentysix twelve November two thousand and thirteen An applicant who has used a remedy which is apparently effective and sufficient cannot be required also to have tried other remedies that were available but probably no more likely to be successful see Hristovi v Bulgaria no fortytwo thousand six hundred and ninetysevenfive  fiftytwo eleven October two thousand and eleven and the cases cited thereinthirtytwo  The Court notes that in the present case during his first medical examination the applicant declared that he had been illtreated by the police see paragraph eight above His statements were qualified as criminal complaints by the investigating authorities see paragraph thirteen above Subsequently a criminal investigation was opened against unknown perpetrators for illtreatment in the course of official proceedings Following the firstinstance decision discontinuing proceedings the applicant lodged a complaint seeking continuation of the investigations see paragraph twentyfour above There is nothing to indicate that the ensuing proceedings would not in principle have been capable of leading to the identification and if appropriate punishment of those responsiblethirtythree  In the Courts view by virtue of that remedy the State had been afforded an opportunity to put matters right The applicant must therefore be regarded as having brought the substance of his complaint to the notice of the national authorities and as having sought redress for his complaint through the domestic channels He was thus not required additionally to pursue the matter by instituting substitute private prosecution proceedings which would have had the same objective as his appeal against the discontinuation of the investigation see for similar reasoning RB v Hungary no sixtyfour thousand six hundred and twotwelve  sixtytwo twelve April two thousand and sixteenthirtyfour  In particular the Court cannot subscribe to the Governments view see paragraph twentyeight above that in the cases of Borbála Kiss and Gubacsi both cited above the applicants were not required to pursue private prosecution proceedings only because of the uncertainty prevailing at that time concerning the effectiveness of that legal avenue Indeed an additional important consideration was the fact that the applicants had already lodged a criminal complaint concerning the alleged illtreatment so that that they could not be expected to have lodged a second virtually identical complaint mentioning particular individuals by name see Borbála Kiss cited above  twentysix and Gubacsi cited above  thirtytwo As to the Governments reference to the Horváth and Vadászi decision cited above the Court considers that the related conclusions reached in that case are not applicable to the present circumstances since in that case the Court found that the applicants had not raised the essence of their claim  which was racial discrimination  in their private bill of indictment which was concerned with endangering minorsthirtyfive  It follows that the Governments preliminary objection of nonexhaustion of domestic remedies must be dismissed Furthermore the Court notes that the application is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone  The parties submissionsa  The applicantthirtysix  The applicant maintained that he had suffered physical illtreatment during his interrogation He further submitted that he could not have inflicted the injuries on himself since he had been held in a waist restraint belt during his transportation in the special vehicle and had otherwise been held under constant supervision He argued that the investigating authorities should have obtained evidence in this respect Furthermore the domestic authorities had no basis for arriving at the conclusion that his injuries had been caused by his own conduct He also submitted that in line with the procedural rules concerning readmission to prison he had undergone a medical checkup for a third time on nineteen July two thousand and twelve see paragraph ten above but the report drawn up during this examination had not formed part of the investigation carried out by the domestic authoritiesthirtyseven  The applicant emphasised that in line with the Courts caselaw the burden of proof rested on the Government to show how and when the injuries of an individual taken into police custody in good health but found to be injured at the time of release had been sustained The Government however had failed plausibly to explain how when and where the injuries had occurred if not at the police station He questioned the authority of the witness testimonies which had been taken more than a year after the incident concerning the origin of his injuriesthirtyeight  The applicant further submitted that the investigation into his allegations had not been adequate for the purpose of Article three Most importantly the investigating authorities had not obtained evidence from the witnesses in due time and the investigation file had not contained all the medical documentation which could have substantiated his allegation of illtreatment They had also failed to question the police officer besides A who had been present for a brief period during the applicants interrogation Moreover the domestic authorities had based their finding solely on the forensic medical expert opinion which had not provided a plausible explanation for the cause of the injuries and had not taken any further investigative stepsb  The Governmentthirtynine  The Government submitted that it could not be established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant had been illtreated by the police officer First they highlighted the contradictions between the applicants account of events  namely that he had been beaten for several minutes with great force  and the findings of the forensic expert opinion according to which the applicants injuries had been of a minor severity Furthermore according to the prosecutors office the applicant had not been constantly monitored thus he could have inflicted the injuries on himself In this respect the Government also emphasised that there was no evidence that the applicant had been restrained during his transportation and the witness testimonies had not shed light on this question either Moreover the applicant had only complained of illtreatment following his transfer back to Budapest Prison and not immediately after his handover from the police to the prison escort officers The Government lastly pointed to the witness testimony of one of the medical staff who had commented when examining the photograph of the applicant that she could not be certain whether he actually had an injury on his face or merely pronounced cheekbones see paragraph twentyone abovetwo  The Courts assessmenta  Concerning the alleged illtreatmentforty  As the Court has stated on many occasions Article three of the Convention enshrines one of the most fundamental values of a democratic society It prohibits in absolute terms torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment irrespective of the circumstances or the conduct of the person concerned see Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine  eightyone ECHR two thousand and fifteen with further references Illtreatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article three The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case such as the duration of the treatment its physical or mental effects and in some cases the sex age and state of health of the victim see Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and fiftynine ECHR two thousand and sixteen extractsfortyone  Allegations of illtreatment contrary to Article three must be supported by appropriate evidence To assess this evidence the Court adopts the standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt but adds that such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightytwofortytwo  On this latter point the Court has explained that where the events in issue lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities as in the case of persons within their control in custody strong presumptions of fact will arise in respect of injuries occurring during such detention The burden of proof then rests with the Government to provide a satisfactory and convincing explanation by producing evidence establishing facts which cast doubt on the account of events given by the victim In the absence of such explanation the Court can draw interferences which may be unfavourable for the Government That is justified by the fact that persons in custody are in a vulnerable position and the authorities are under a duty to protect them see among other authorities Bouyid cited above  eightythreefortythree  In the instant case the applicant complained that during his interrogation he was subjected to acts of police brutality The Court notes that medical reports confirmed that the applicant had suffered bleeding on the lower lip bruises on the ribs and sensitivity at his jaw see paragraph nine above The Court considers that in the instant case the injury suffered by the applicant was sufficiently serious to amount to illtreatment within the scope of Article threefortyfour  In the light of the parties submissions the witness testimonies and the relevant medical evidence it is uncontested that the applicants injuries were sustained while under the control of the state authorities either during his questioning at the police station or thereafter when he was being transferred or readmitted to the prison see paragraphs nine and fifteentwentytwo aboveThe disagreement between the parties concerned the exact nature and causes of the applicants injuriesfortyfive  The Court observes that the investigation into forced interrogation was discontinued on the grounds that the applicants statements could not be corroborated by any testimony in the absence of eye witnesses during questioning see paragraph twentyfour above Moreover the forensic expert opinion did not confirm the applicants account of the incident stating that the nature of the injuries excluded that they could have been caused by the mechanism described by the applicant That opinion even assumed based on the location of the injuries that they could have been selfinflicted see paragraph twentythree above This conclusion was also supported by the Government in their submissions see paragraph thirtynine abovefortysix  It is true that no conclusive evidence is available concerning the time at which the injuries occurred and the other circumstances surrounding the incident In particular the Court finds no elements which could indicate with sufficient certainty that the injuries sustained by the applicant were inflicted by use of force by the police Furthermore there is no evidence in the case file which could call into question the findings of the medical report or could add probative weight to the applicants allegationsfortyseven  In the light of the foregoing the Court cannot consider it established beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was subjected to illtreatment during his time in police custodyfortyeight  It follows that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention under its substantive aspectb  Concerning the alleged inadequacy of the investigationfortynine  The Court refers to the general principles set out among other judgments in ElMasri v the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia GC no thirtynine thousand six hundred and thirtynine  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive ECHR two thousand and twelve and Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts among other judgments Those principles indicate in particular that the investigation into serious allegations of illtreatment must be both prompt and thorough and authorities must always make a serious attempt to find out what happened and take all reasonable steps available to them to secure the evidence concerning the incident including inter alia eyewitness testimony and forensic evidence Any deficiency in the investigation which undermines its ability to establish the cause of injuries or the identity of the persons responsible will risk falling foul of this standardfifty  In the present case the Court finds that the applicants injuries were serious enough see paragraphs nine and fortythree above and that his complaint of illtreatment was arguable for the purposes of Article three thus requiring the domestic authorities to carry out an effective investigationfiftyone  The Court observes that in the present case it was established that the applicant had no injuries before the interrogation and that the key element of consideration for the investigation authorities was whether the applicant could have inflicted the injuries on himself a possibility suggested by the forensic expert opinion see paragraph twentythree above The only viable means for the Central Investigation Office to obtain certainty on this point would have been to hear the testimony of the police officers present during his questioning A and B of the escort officers accompanying the applicant during his transfer in an outside the prison facilities C D E G H and I and of the medical staff who examined the applicant before his readmission F the three members of the medical staff mentioned in paragraph twentyone above and the prison doctorfiftytwo  However the investigating authorities obtained such testimony from the prison escort officers and medical staff only after a certain period of time had lapsed in some cases more than a year after the incident see paragraphs fifteen to twentytwo above At this point most of the witnesses no longer had any recollection whatsoever of the events and could not even recognise the applicant from a photo Even those officers on duty who had been with the applicant for an extended time could not recall the exact details of his transfer This was mainly so according to the witnesses own assessment because they had been responsible for the admission transfer and examination of a large number of detainees on a daily basis making it impossible to distinguish cases after a certain lapse of time The witnesses could therefore only reply to the investigation authorities questions in a general manner or theoretically without an actual link to the present case For the Court the delay in questioning the witnesses significantly tainted the official investigation being pursued by the State authorities which was not redressed by the fact that they were ultimately heard in the course of the investigationsfiftythree  On the other hand the Court observes that the names of the persons on duty on the day of the incident must have been easily accessible to the investigation authorities Moreover there is nothing in the case file  and the Government did not provide any elements either  indicating that the investigation authorities had been prevented from questioning the witnesses in due time In the Courts view the prosecutors office made no genuine efforts for a considerable length of time to establish how the applicants injuries could have occurredfiftyfour  The Court further observes that the applicant alleged that he had been illtreated by police officer A However neither he nor B the other police officer present during the questioning according to the police report see paragraphs six and eleven above was questioned during the investigation The unsatisfactory course of action followed by the domestic authorities was unlikely to shed light on the central element of their inquiry namely whether the police officer used force against the applicant during interrogationfiftyfive  Similarly no further measures were taken with a view to resolving the discrepancy between the version of events documented in the police report and the allegations of the applicant A possible investigative measure in this respect could have been to organise a facetoface confrontation see mutatis mutandis Bouyid cited above  one hundred and twentyeight in order to assess the credibility of each sides statements as regards the factsfiftysix  Given the above the Court finds that the authorities did not do all that could have been reasonably expected of them to investigate the incidentfiftyseven  Accordingly the Court finds that the domestic authorities failed to carry out an effective investigation into the applicants complaint and that there has therefore been a violation of Article three of the Convention in its procedural limbII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damagefiftynine  The applicant claimed tenzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damagesixty  The Government contested this claimsixtyone  Taking into account all the circumstances of the present case the Court accepts that the applicant has suffered nonpecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation Making its assessment on an equitable basis the Court awards the applicant EUR sixzero in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeableB  Costs and expensessixtytwo  The applicant also claimed EUR sixfour hundred plus VAT for the costs and expenses incurred before the Court This amount corresponded to thirtytwo hours of legal work billable by his lawyer at an hourly rate of EUR two hundred plus VATsixtythree  The Government contested this claimsixtyfour  According to the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum In the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria the Court considers it reasonable to award EUR twozero for the proceedings before the CourtC  Default interestsixtyfive  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points

       "1  I  SCOPE OF THE CASEnineteen  After notice of the application was given to the Government in his observations of twentynine March two thousand and sixteen in reply to those of the Government the applicant who suffers from thyroid dysfunction and arthritis complained under Article three of the Convention that he had not been provided with proper health care for these medical conditions in custody Relying on the same Article he also complained that his mother had died in February two thousand and sixteen because he had been unable to take care of her owing to the authorities refusal to interrupt the serving of his sentence or to grant him early releasetwenty  The Government did not comment on these pointstwentyone  The Court notes that in his initial application the applicant did not raise a complaint about the lack of proper medical care in custody separate from the complaint about the material conditions of his detention In his initial application he did rely on Article three of the Convention with regard to the authorities refusal to interrupt the serving of his sentence in two thousand and nine when his mother had undergone hipreplacement surgery and with regard to the prison authorities alleged failure to manage properly the hunger strike which he had undertaken to protest against that refusal those complaints were declared inadmissible by the President under Rule fiftyfour  three of the Rules of Court However the two complaints raised after notice of the application was given to the Government concern new facts which took place several years after the lodging of the application in two thousand and ninetwentytwo  In these circumstances the two complaints raised in the applicants observations in reply to those of the Government must be regarded as new rather than an elaboration of the original complaint concerning the conditions of his detention It is therefore not appropriate to take them up for examination at this stage see among other authorities Shesti Mai Engineering OOD and Others v Bulgaria no seventeen thousand eight hundred and fiftyfourfour  ninetyfour twenty September two thousand and eleven Rafig Aliyev v Azerbaijan no fortyfive thousand eight hundred and seventyfivesix  sixtynine six December two thousand and eleven and Yefimova v Russia no thirtynine thousand seven hundred and eightysixnine  one hundred and seventyseven nineteen February two thousand and thirteenII  THE CONDITIONS OF THE APPLICANTS DETENTIONtwentythree  The applicant complained of the conditions of his detention in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel He relied on Article three of the Convention which providesNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilitytwentyfour  The complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention or inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone  The conditions of the applicants detention from twentyone August two thousand and nine until twentyeight October two thousand and tentwentyfive  The applicant was initially housed in one of the buildings of Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel situated in the guarded area of the hostel He remained there a little more than a year between August two thousand and nine and October two thousand and ten with a gap of two months between August and October two thousand and nine when the serving of his sentence was interrupted After twentyeight October two thousand and ten he was transferred to another celltwentysix  In two thousand and ten the CPT noted that the number of inmates housed in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel in two thousand and eight was six hundred and twentytwo which was higher than its official capacity of four hundred and twentysix see paragraphs fifteen and seventeen above In two thousand and eight the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee made similar findings see paragraph sixteen above In his two thousand and twelve report the Ombudsman likewise noted severe overcrowding poor hygiene and bad sanitary living conditions in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel see paragraph eighteen above All these findings match the applicants allegations see paragraphs eight and nine abovetwentyseven  The Court refers to the principles established in its caselaw regarding poor conditions of detention see a recent authority Muršić v Croatia GC no seven thousand three hundred and thirtyfourthirteen  ninetysixone hundred and one ECHR two thousand and sixteen It notes in particular that a severe lack of space in a detention cell weighs heavily for establishing whether conditions of detention amount to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article three of the Convention and may disclose a violation both alone or taken together with other shortcomings ibid  one hundred and twentytwofortyonetwentyeight  In the pilot case of Neshkov and Others v Bulgaria nos thirtysix thousand nine hundred and twentyfiveten and five others  two hundred and fortyfivefiftysix twentyseven January two thousand and fifteen the Court already found a breach of Article three of the Convention in relation to issues similar to those in the present casetwentynine  Having examined all the material before it and taking into account its caselaw on this domain the Court considers that the conditions of the applicants detention from twentyone August two thousand and nine until twentyeight October two thousand and ten in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel with the exception of the period from twentysix August two thousand and nine until twentysix October two thousand and nine when the serving of the applicants sentence was interrupted were in breach of Article three of the Conventiontwo  The conditions of the applicants detention after twentyeight October two thousand and tenthirty  The Court notes that the only point raised by the applicant in respect of the conditions of his detention after twentyeight October two thousand and ten when he was transferred to another cell relates to insufficient access to water for taking a shower due to lower water pressure The Government disputed those allegations saying that there had been no restrictions on the water supplythirtyone  Having regard to the overall conditions in which the applicant was detained in Kremikovtsi Prison Hostel after twentyeight October two thousand and ten the Court concludes that they did not reach the threshold of severity required under Article three of the Conventionthirtytwo  It follows that there has been no breach of Article three of the Convention with respect to this periodIII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONthirtythree  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows

sixzero in respect of nonpecuniary damagethirtyfive  The Government submitted that the claims were unjustified and excessivethirtysix  Regarding the claim in respect of pecuniary damage the Court finds no causal link between the conditions of the applicants detention and his alleged loss of earnings see Dvoynykh v Ukraine no seventytwo thousand two hundred and seventysevenone  seventysix twelve October two thousand and six that loss was due to his imprisonment rather than the conditions in which it took placethirtyseven  As for the claim in respect of nonpecuniary damage the Court notes that the breach of Article three of the Convention concerned the applicants detention in poor conditions for a period of about a year Having regard to the materials in its possession and its caselaw the Court finds it reasonable to award him EUR threezero in respect of nonpecuniary damageB  Costs and expensesthirtyeight  The applicant sought reimbursement of EUR oneone hundred and forty

fact BGN three hundred and twentysix EUR one hundred and sixtyseven which sum should be awarded under this head of the claimC  Default interestfortyone  The Court considers it appropriate that the

       "2  I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES three AND thirteen OF THE CONVENTIONsixtythree  The applicant complained under Article three regarding the injuries he had sustained as a result of the police intervention and alleged that the investigation with a view to identifying and punishing the perpetrators had not been effective Article three reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentsixtyfour  Having regard to the circumstances of this case the Court considered it appropriate to communicate of its own motion a question under Article thirteen of the Convention which reads as followsEveryone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in the Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacitysixtyfive  The Government contested the applicants argumentsA  Admissibilityone  As regards the submission of a civil claim under Articles six hundred and eight et seq of the Civil Code and Article sixtyone of the CCPsixtysix  The Government submitted that the applicant had failed to exhaust domestic remedies such as a civil claim for damages under Articles six hundred and eight six hundred and twentyfive and six hundred and forty of the Civil Code and the unifying decision of the Supreme Court of thirteen September two thousand and seven for damage caused by the alleged offence of torture and a civil claim in the course of criminal proceedings under Article sixtyone of the CCPsixtyseven  The applicant submitted that a civil claim for damages could not lead to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the Article three violation In any event those remedies could only be effective after the cause of the damage had been established The domestic caselaw submitted by the Government was not applicable in his case since all those cases were different from his The criminal proceedings under Article sixtyone of the CCP could only be used in the event that a criminal charge was pressed against someone and the case was sent for trial before the domestic courts Therefore such a claim could not offer any prospects of success in his case since the investigation had been stayed and no charges had been pressed against anyonesixtyeight  The Court reiterates that in the area of unlawful use of force by State agents  and not mere fault omission or negligence  civil or administrative proceedings aimed solely at awarding damages rather than ensuring the identification and punishment of those responsible are not adequate and effective remedies capable of providing redress for complaints based on the substantive aspect of Articles two and three of the Convention see inter alia Yaşa v Turkey two September one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeight  seventyfour Reports of Judgments and Decisions one thousand nine hundred and ninetyeightVI Mocanu and Others v Romania GC nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  two hundred and twentyseven ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts and Jeronovičs v Latvia GC no fortyfour thousand eight hundred and ninetyeightten  seventysix ECHR two thousand and sixteensixtynine  The Contracting Parties obligation under Articles two and three of the Convention to conduct an investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible in cases of assault could be rendered illusory if in respect of complaints under those Articles an applicant were required to bring an action leading only to an award of damages see Mocanu and Others cited above  two hundred and thirtyfour and Jeronovičs cited above  seventysevenseventy  In the present case the Court notes that the applicant alleged that the State had failed to comply with the obligations imposed on it under the substantive aspect of Article three of the Convention and under the procedural aspect of the said Article to conduct an effective investigation capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible for the alleged illtreatment In this connection the Court observes that a civil claim for damages under the Albanian Civil Code and CCP is aimed solely at awarding damages rather than ensuring the identification and punishment of those responsibleseventyone  For the reasons set out above the Court considers that the remedies put forward by the Government are not sufficient in that they are not capable of providing redress for the situation complained of by the applicanttwo  As regards lodging a premature application and an appeal before a higherranking prosecutorseventytwo  The Government submitted that the criminal proceedings had not yet been terminated since the interlocutory decision of seven June two thousand and thirteen had triggered another opportunity to identify the perpetrators The applicant had also failed to lodge an appeal against the prosecutors decision of seven June two thousand and thirteen with a higherranking prosecutor under Article twentyfour of the CCPseventythree  The applicant submitted that the fact that the investigation had been stayed meant that a violation under Article three of the Convention still continued He further argued that no appeal against a prosecutors decision to stay an investigation was provided for in domestic lawseventyfour  The Court notes that one of the applicants complaints is that the investigation of his allegation of illtreatment was ineffective It finds that the Governments objection that the case had not yet been terminated and that the applicant also failed to lodge an appeal under Article twentyfour of the CCP is closely related to his complaint regarding the effectiveness of the investigation It therefore joins this objection to the merits of the case under Articles three and thirteen of the Conventionthree  Conclusionseventyfive  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds They must therefore be declared admissible without prejudice to the decision ultimately to be taken on the Governments objection as to nonexhaustion of domestic remediesB  Meritsone  Alleged violation of the substantive aspect of Article three of the Conventiona  The parties submissionsseventysix  The applicant submitted that the investigation file and the prosecutors decision substantiated the fact that six police officers had used violence against him This had been supported by other witnesses statements The authorities had humiliated him by publicly using violence They had used rubber truncheons on him in front of his fellow citizens causing him serious injuries There was no evidence that the applicant had caused the fight or been a protagonist Furthermore there had been no use of any blunt objects by the applicant or the other people involved in the fight None of the witnesses had stated that those objects had been used at the scene The applicant further submitted that the Government had failed to show any specific behaviour on his part that had necessitated the use of violence by the police including the unlimited use of force Therefore the authorities had used unnecessary and disproportionate force against him resulting in serious damage to his health The police actions had been unplanned unorganised and unprofessional Indeed it had not been the RRF police officers duty to protect public order in the city The authorities acts had constituted inhuman and degrading treatmentseventyseven  The Government submitted that the factual circumstances of the case did not disclose that the applicant had been subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment There had been no evidence to substantiate or create any suspicion that the police officers had used violence against him or that his injuries had been caused by them The applicants statements did not constitute a credible assertion as they were contradictory The investigation had proved the fact that the applicant had been a protagonist in the physical dispute which had resulted in the use of beer bottles and other hard objects Except for the applicants inconsistent statements there had been no other statements saying that the police officers had used objects like these There was no basis for saying that the applicants injuries had not been caused as a result of his physical dispute with the other people Furthermore the witnesses had not stated that they had had a physical dispute with the police The standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt had not been met in the present case The violence used by the police officers if any used with the aim of protecting others involved in the fight could not be qualified as torture within the meaning of Article three of the Conventionb  The Courts assessmentseventyeight  The Court refers to the general principles set out in Bouyid v Belgium GC no twentythree thousand three hundred and eightynine   eightyoneninety ECHR two thousand and fifteenseventynine  The Court notes that the material in its possession conclusively demonstrates that on the day of the events in issue the applicant sustained injuries Indeed the forensic medical report produced a day after the events on seven August two thousand and twelve  the authenticity of which is not contested  mentions that the applicant was injured by a hard blunt object mjet i fortë mbretës see paragraph twenty above Furthermore the applicant was unable to work for nine days Therefore the Court concludes that the applicants injuries were sufficiently serious to fall within the ambit of Article three of the Conventioneighty  The Court observes at the outset that the parties are in dispute about whether the applicant was subjected to the use of force by the police officers at all Therefore it remains to be determined whether the State authorities can be held responsible for having inflicted those injuries and held accountable under the above provisioneightyone  The Court notes that throughout the investigation the applicant consistently claimed that the authorities had used force against him The applicants account of events was corroborated by two witnesses NP and NiP questioned in the course of the investigation see also paragraph twentynine above However equally consistently all the police officers in question claimed the opposite They consistently stated that the applicant had had an injury to the back of his head from the outset that he had been involved in the fight and that they had not used any force against him see paragraphs  nine ten fourteen and thirtytwothirtyfour above This account of events was corroborated by witnesses AS AE and JK in their statements of seven August and seventeen October two thousand and twelve and fifteen January two thousand and thirteen In these circumstances it is clear that the whole set of events did not lie wholly or in large part within the exclusive knowledge of the authorities While the medical report in respect of the applicant was produced a day after the events this is not sufficient for the Court to conclude certainly not beyond reasonable doubt that he was indeed illtreated in breach of Article three of the Convention see mutatis mutandis Habimi and Others v Serbia no nineteen thousand and seventytwoeight  eightynine three June two thousand and fourteen The second expert report carried out by the FMI stated that it had been impossible to identify the object that had caused the applicants injuries Moreover there were some indications to the effect that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused as a consequence of him and the other people being involved in the fight before the police intervention According to the prosecutors decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen the applicant had been hit by another man prior to the police intervention during the physical dispute The Court notes that the prosecutors decision stated that doubts had arisen as to whether the offence of abuse of power had been committed on the grounds that the injuries sustained by the applicant might have been caused while he was being escorted to the police station by the RRF officers Nevertheless the Court notes that in his written observations the applicant did not submit any claim concerning any alleged illtreatment against him while being escorted by the police officers to the police station He strongly maintained that the police officers had beaten him in public in the main street of the city  In these circumstances the Court considers that it is not apparent that the applicant was still in good health when the authorities arrived at the scene see for instance Kobets v Ukraine no sixteen thousand four hundred and thirtysevenfour  fortysixfortyeight fourteen February two thousand and eighteightytwo  In such circumstances given all the information in its possession and in the light of the principles established by the Court in the recent case of Bouyid cited above where there was compelling evidence pointing to the fact that the applicants injuries had been caused by police officers as stated by that applicant see also Kulyk v Ukraine no thirty thousand seven hundred and sixtysix  eightythree twentythree June two thousand and sixteen the Court cannot but find that there has been no violation of the substantive aspect of Article three of the Conventiontwo  Alleged violation of the procedural aspect of Article three of the Conventiona  The parties submissionseightythree  The applicant submitted that the authorities had failed to conduct an effective and independent investigation into the incident They had failed to clarify how he had sustained wounds to the back of his head his back and shoulders No additional witnesses had been questioned and no material evidence such as hard objects had been examined by the authorities The authorities had failed to determine which officers were responsible and thus to identify and punish the perpetrators No medical aid had been given by the authorities and the applicant had been sent to hospital with the help of his family memberseightyfour  The applicant further submitted that the investigation had not been expeditious in that he had submitted a criminal complaint in August two thousand and twelve and the authorities had only informed him in June two thousand and thirteen that the investigation had been stayed Under Article three hundred and twentythree  one of the CCP a preliminary investigation should take no more than three months while in the present case the police officers had only been questioned five months after the incidenteightyfive  Moreover the applicant had not been involved in the investigation proceedings Indeed he had not been notified of the investigation being extended He had not been provided with copies of documents from the criminal investigation file in accordance with Article one hundred and five of the CCP The authorities having failed to inform him of actions taken in accordance with Articles fiftyeight and one hundred and five of the CCP had clearly denied him any effective remedy Furthermore the police officers had not been suspended from duty during the investigation Moreover according to the applicant under Article two hundred and fortyeight of the Criminal Code prosecution of the offence of abuse of power was timebarred after five years The delays allowed by the prosecution and the prosecutions decision to stay the investigation had enabled the perpetrators to avoid responsibilityeightysix  The Government submitted that the authorities had acted diligently and that an effective official investigation had taken place with the aim of punishing the perpetrators The authorities had accompanied the applicant to hospital so that he could receive medical aid following his complaints regarding the injuries he had sustained The investigation had been expeditious in that it had started within minutes of the incident taking placeeightyseven  The Government further submitted that the prosecutor and judicial police officers had taken several procedural measures During the criminal proceedings the applicant had not raised any complaint concerning any omission or refusal by the authorities to carry out any procedural action In circumstances where a possibility had existed that the applicant had made a false charge against the police officers and where it had also been impossible to identify the perpetrators the authorities had stayed the investigation but they had not discontinued the case Indeed the prosecutors decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen had ordered the performance of specific actions to identify the perpetrators Therefore the investigation had not yet been closedb  The Courts assessmenteightyeight  The Court refers to the general principles set out in inter alia ElMasri cited above  one hundred and eightytwoone hundred and eightyfive Mocanu and Others v Romania GC cited above nos ten thousand eight hundred and sixtyfivenine and two others  three hundred and sixteenthree hundred and twentysix ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts and Bouyid cited above  one hundred and fourteenone hundred and twentythreeeightynine  The Court reiterates that lack of conclusions arising from any given investigation does not by itself mean that it was ineffective Not every investigation should necessarily be successful or come to a conclusion which coincides with the claimants account of events however it should in principle be capable of leading to the establishment of the facts of the case and if the allegations prove to be true to the identification and punishment of those responsible see Mikheyev v Russia no seventyseven thousand six hundred and seventeenone  one hundred and seven twentysix January two thousand and sixninety  The Court observes that following the applicants complaint the domestic authorities carried out an inquiry into his allegations of illtreatment A number of investigative steps were taken by the authorities witnesses were questioned register logs of the police station were examined the footage from the closed circuit video cameras of two nearby banks was obtained and examined and another forensic medical report was obtained The Court accepts that the authorities reacted to the complaints of the applicant however it is not convinced that their response to his allegations was sufficiently thorough or effective to meet the requirements of Article threeninetyone  More specifically the Court notes that the applicant in the present case was not provided with satisfactory updates on the status of the investigation or given any access to documents see paragraphs fortyfortythree above see Barysheva v Ukraine no nine thousand five hundred and fivetwelve  fiftyninesixtyone fourteen March two thousand and seventeen Therefore the Court considers the Governments allegation that the applicant did not complain about the authorities refusal to carry out any procedural action unfounded when the applicant did not have any real opportunity to do soninetytwo  The Court further notes that the proceedings were initially conducted with the required expediency However some of the essential investigative measures were taken inexplicably late In this connection the Court notes that although the applicant had complained to the authorities on the day of the incident six August two thousand and twelve and had also lodged a criminal complaint against the RRF police officers two days after the incident the police officers involved were only questioned by the prosecutor five months after the incident In this connection the Court reiterates that it has repeatedly underlined the importance of contacting and questioning witnesses in the immediate aftermath of such incidents when memories are fresh see for example Doiciu v Romania no one thousand four hundred and fiftyfournine  sixtytwo five May two thousand and fifteen Furthermore the second forensic medical report in the case was produced seven months after the incident see Dinu v Romania no sixtyfour thousand three hundred and fiftysixfourteen  eightytwo seven February two thousand and seventeenninetythree  The Court further notes that there were also other deficiencies The prosecuting authorities questioned two witnesses who testified in support of the applicant and six police officers and three witnesses who testified against him However the reasoning in the prosecutors decision to stay the investigation did not contain any assessment of the witness testimonies in favour of the applicant The prosecutor did not provide any explanation as to why those testimonies were considered less credible than the statements of the police officers and the three other witnesses see Mustafa Hajili v Azerbaijan no fortytwo thousand one hundred and nineteentwelve  fiftytwo twentyfour November two thousand and sixteen Despite the fact that their statements clearly conflicted with the applicants statement the prosecutor in charge of the case did not order a formal facetoface confrontation between the applicant and the police officers or even an identification parade even though the applicant explicitly asked for one see Chmil v Ukraine no twenty thousand eight hundred and sixten  eightynine twentynine October two thousand and fifteen and Hilal Mammadov v Azerbaijan no eightyone thousand five hundred and fiftythreetwelve  ninetysix four February two thousand and sixteenninetyfour  The Court also notes that the final decision in the case  the decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen to stay the investigation  does not provide any definite answer as to how the applicants injuries were inflicted Likewise it does not refute the possibility that the injuries in question could have resulted from police violence the prosecutor herself casting doubt on the cause of the applicants injuries without giving further reasons Furthermore in reply to the Governments submission that the investigation has not yet been completed the Court notes that even though more than four years have elapsed since the investigation was stayed the police authorities have not taken any other investigative steps since then The Government did not provide any document to report on the progress made by the police authorities in a further attempt to clarify the facts complained of by the applicant Therefore in view of the seriousness of the issues at stake the Court does not consider that the applicant should have waited for the outcome of any further investigation by the ICS as in any event the police authorities had not taken any further investigative measures since the staying of the proceedings by the district prosecutor on thirteen May two thousand and thirteen see mutatis mutandis Barakhoyev v Russia no eight thousand five hundred and sixteeneight  thirtyeight seventeen January two thousand and seventeenninetyfive  As regards an appeal under Article twentyfour of the CCP the Court notes that under the domestic law as in force at the relevant time a higherranking prosecutor had the right to overrule the decisions of a lowerranking prosecutor However the Court notes that the CCP did not provide for any right to appeal against a prosecutors decision staying a criminal investigation Furthermore in its decision of eighteen January two thousand and thirteen the Constitutional Court noted that there was no remedy under domestic law against a prosecutors decision staying an investigation Moreover under Article three hundred and twentysix of the CCP the investigation could only be reopened by a prosecutors decision In view of the above considerations and also noting that the Government did not submit any domestic caselaw the Court has serious doubts as to whether the domestic courts would indeed have admitted for examination an appeal by the applicant against the decision of thirteen May two thousand and thirteen Taking the abovementioned factors into consideration the Court considers that the remedy in issue would not have provided the applicant with any adequate redress for his grievancesninetysix  Lastly the Court notes the applicants complaint regarding the independence of the investigation The Court considers that it is not required to address this issue in the absence of any specific submission by the applicant and given that the investigation taken as a whole was ineffective owing to the deficiencies described aboveninetyseven  The foregoing considerations are sufficient to enable the Court to conclude that the investigation of the applicants claim of illtreatment was ineffective Therefore the Court dismisses the Governments preliminary objection regarding the nonexhaustion of domestic remedies and finds that the applicant has suffered a violation of the procedural aspect of Article three of the Conventionninetyeight  Having regard to its finding under Article three the Court considers that it is not necessary to examine whether there has also been a violation of Article thirteen of the Convention in this caseII  OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE CONVENTIONninetynine  In his application form the applicant also complained under Article three of the Convention that he had been threatened abused and illtreated while being escorted to the police station However the applicant did not submit any specific claim in his observations before the Courtone hundred  In view of all the information available in the case file and the lack of submissions by both parties the Court considers that there is no evidence that the applicant was indeed threatened or abused as alleged The applicants complaint is therefore manifestly illfounded and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionIII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and one  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damageone hundred and two  The applicant claimed fivezero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damageone hundred and three  The Government contested the applicants claim as illfounded on the basis of the facts and the evidenceone hundred and four  Having regard to the finding of a violation of Article three of the Convention under its procedural limb and making its assessment on an equitable basis the Court awards the applicant EUR threezero in respect of nonpecuniary damageB  Costs and expensesone hundred and five  The applicant also claimed EUR twothirteen for costs and expenses incurred before the Court That included a lump sum of EUR onefive hundred as regards the legal fee for his representation and EUR five hundred and thirteen as regards translation postal and photocopying expensesone hundred and six  The Government contested the applicants claim as illfounded on the basis of the facts and the evidenceone hundred and seven  In accordance with the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum see Gjyli v Albania no thirtytwo thousand nine hundred and sevenseven  seventytwo twentynine September two thousand and nine In the present case regard being had to the documents in its possession and

       "3  I  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTIONthirtytwo  The applicant complained under Article three of the Convention about the conditions of his detention in Krasnoye Selo Article three reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilitythirtythree  The Court observes at the outset that the applicant complained about the conditions of his detention from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to five August two thousand and sixteen the date when he lodged his application with the Court as well as about the conditions of his continued detention after that date Having regard to the available information the parties submissions and the scope of the present case the Court considers it appropriate to examine the complaint as concerning the period from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen see for the approach albeit in the context of a continuous situation under Article five  three of the Convention Novokreshchin v Russia Committee no forty thousand five hundred and seventythreeeight  eleveneighteen twentyseven November two thousand and fourteen and Kalinin v Russia Committee no fiftyfour thousand seven hundred and fortyninetwelve  three and fifteen nineteen February two thousand and fifteen Both parties have been expressly afforded an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the entire period Indeed in their observations in February two thousand and seventeen as well as in their further observations the Government commented on the contemporaneous conditions of the applicants detention in cell no four hundred and six in which the applicant had been kept from January two thousand and seventeen until his release in June two thousand and seventeen It appears that the material conditions remained essentially the same during this final period of timethirtyfour  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsthirtyfive  The Court notes that the Governments submissions only concern the applicants conditions of detention which were contemporaneous with the Governments submission of their observations to the Court in February two thousand and seventeen After examining the applicants detailed submissions the other available material and in the absence of any submissions from the Government the Court considers it appropriate to rely on the applicants account of the material conditions of his detention as regards the period from fifteen December two thousand and fifteen to twentyone January two thousand and seventeenthirtysix  The Court observes that the applicant did not allege that he had been kept at the relevant time in severely overcrowded conditions resulting for instance in him not having an individual sleeping place and having to take it in turns to sleep see by contrast Kim v Russia no fortyfour thousand two hundred and sixtythirteen  eighteennineteen and fortyonefiftyseven seventeen July two thousand and fourteen concerning the same detention facility in two thousand and thirteen and Georgia v Russia I GC no thirteen thousand two hundred and fiftyfiveseven  one hundred and ninetynine ECHR two thousand and fourteen extracts It follows from the applicants own submissions that detainees had fourfourfive square metres of floor space each including space occupied by furniture but not the cell toilet area when he was detained with three other people in the cells located on the fourth floor of the detention centrethirtyseven  In the Courts view the above consideration is not by itself sufficient to conclude that there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention compare Khlaifia and Others v Italy GC no sixteen thousand four hundred and eightythreetwelve  one hundred and sixtythreesixtyseven and one hundred and seventyseventyseven ECHR two thousand and sixteen extractsthirtyeight  As regards the other aspects see paragraphs twentytwentyfive above it is first noted that the toilet was separated from the main area by a partition and usually a curtain The available material including photographs submitted by the applicant does not disclose whether that arrangement raised any particular problem of privacy The applicant has also not specified in what manner the presence of bars on the windows posed a problem no particular consequences arose from that measure relating to the entry of natural light or air into the cell The allegation concerning mice was first raised in the applicants observations in reply to the Governments submissions It has not been argued that that was a pervasive problem at the material time or that the authorities did nothing to deal with itthirtynine  In so far as they have been substantiated and established in the present case the remaining aspects of the material conditions of confinement up to twentyone January two thousand and seventeen relating to the light in the cell during the night food hygiene and sanitary arrangements or activities in the detention centre were not shown to have reached the minimum threshold of severity and thus did not amount to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article three of the Convention Lastly nothing suggests that the applicant had any health issues that would require attention and could be pertinent in assessing the material conditions of confinementforty  As regards the conditions of the applicants detention from twentytwo January to twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen the Court discerns no significant factual elements to give a different assessmentfortyone  There has accordingly been no violation of Article three of the Convention as regards the conditions of the applicants detentionII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five  one OF THE CONVENTIONfortytwo  Referring to the Courts findings under Articles five and fortysix of the Convention in Kim cited above  fortyonefiftyseven and sixtyeightseventyfour the applicant complained that his detention had been and remained as of August two thousand and sixteen unlawful and arbitrary since it should have been clear to the authorities that his removal was impracticablefortythree  Article five  one of the Convention reads as followsone  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawf  the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extraditionfortyfour  The applicant submitted that it had been clear and had remained so all along that no State was willing to accept him and that he was a stateless person with no right of entry anywhere As early as two thousand and fifteen the Russian authorities had been told that the applicant had no right to enter or reside in Georgia However they had not attempted to negotiate with the Georgian authorities after that clarificationfortyfive  The Government argued that it had been possible to detain the applicant for two years which was the period for enforcing the final penalty of administrative removalfortysix  The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissiblefortyseven  It is not disputed that the applicants detention in a centre for foreigners amounted to a deprivation of liberty and that it fell within the ambit of subparagraph f of Article five  one of the Convention The Court also notes that the applicant did not complain about his arrest and detention before or during the trial on fifteen December two thousand and fifteen Nor did he complain about his detention during the appeal proceedings which ended with the decision of twentysix January two thousand and sixteenfortyeight  There is no dispute about the fact that at all stages of the administrativeoffence proceedings the Russian authorities including the courts and the bailiff service were aware that the applicant was a stateless person The impracticability of his removal to Georgia should have become obvious to them no later than twentyfour March two thousand and sixteen when the Georgian authorities reiterated their earlier statement that the applicant was not a Georgian national and that there were no other legal grounds for assistance to the Russian authorities inter alia by way of providing documents for his entry into Georgia The Court has not been provided with sufficient information concerning any other plausible options for enforcing the penalty of removal in terms of arrangements for his removal such as reliance on a readmission procedure or agreement or in terms of a country of destination apart from removal to Georgia There is also no indication of the Russian authorities taking any steps towards the implementation of any such alternative solutionsfortynine  Having regard to the Courts findings in similar cases concerning the same legal framework see SK v Russia no fiftytwo thousand seven hundred and twentytwofifteen  one hundred and tenseventeen fourteen February two thousand and seventeen with further references and with particular regard to the context of the applicants situation as a stateless person the Court concludes that there have been violations of Article five  one of the Convention as regards the applicants detention counting at least from late March two thousand and sixteen to his release on twentytwo June two thousand and seventeenIII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five  four OF THE CONVENTIONfifty  The applicant complained under Article five  four of the Convention about the legal possibility to take proceedings to have the legality of and his continued detention reviewed by a court or have other pertinent aspects examined He also complained about the delay in the examination of his appeal against the judgment of fifteen December two thousand and fifteen in so far as it concerned his placement in a detention centre for foreignersfiftyone  Article five  four reads as followsfour  Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawfulA  The parties submissionsfiftytwo  The Government acknowledged that Article five  four had been violated on account of the length of the appeal proceedings in respect of the court decisions dated fifteen December two thousand and fifteen and twentysix January two thousand and sixteenfiftythree  The applicant maintained his complaint concerning the length of the appeal proceedings against the judgment of fifteen December two thousand and fifteen in so far as it concerned the detention matter He also maintained his complaint concerning the lack of a possibility to take proceedings for a review of his continued detention after January two thousand and sixteen As an example he referred to his case against the bailiff service in particular the fact that it had taken some three months to obtain an appeal decision see paragraph fifteen aboveB  The Courts assessmentfiftyfour  As regards the first complaint the Court notes that the relevant appeal decision was issued on twentysix January two thousand and sixteen while the related complaint about the length of the appeal proceedings in so far as it concerned the detention matter was first raised before the Court on five August two thousand and sixteen There is no reason to consider that the applicant or his lawyer were not immediately aware of that decision or that it is relevant to take into account for the purpose of applying the sixmonth rule the decision dated twentyfour June two thousand and sixteen taken in the review procedure under Article thirtytwelve of the CAO see also Smadikov v Russia dec no ten thousand eight hundred and tenfifteen thirtyone January two thousand and seventeen Accordingly this complaint has been lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  one and four of the Conventionfiftyfive  As regards the complaint about the absence of a review procedure in respect of the continued detention the Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissiblefiftysix  The Court has taken note of the findings in the ruling dated twentythree May two thousand and seventeen by the Constitutional Court in the applicants case However in terms of Article five  one and four of the Convention those findings have no direct bearing in respect of the assessments of the facts and procedure which mostly predated that ruling As to subsequent events the Court observes that on twentytwo June two thousand and seventeen a district court examined an application for release lodged on five June two thousand and seventeen and allowed it with reference to the constitutional rulingfiftyseven  Having regard to the Courts findings in similar cases see SK v Russia cited above  one hundred and fournine with further references the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article five  four of the ConventionIV  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONfiftyeight  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damagefiftynine  The applicant claimed compensation in respect of nonpecuniary damage leaving the amount to the Courts discretion He specified that as a stateless person he would be unable to open a bank account and thus requested that the Court authorise payment of any just satisfaction award into his representatives bank accountsixty  The Government made no specific commentsixtyone  The Court awards the applicant sevenfive hundred euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damage plus any tax that may be chargeable Should it facilitate payment of that sum the Court considers it appropriate that the amount awarded to him by way of just satisfaction should be held in trust for him by his representative Ms O Tseytlina compare Khamidkariyev v Russia no fortytwo thousand three hundred and thirtytwofourteen  one hundred and seventyone twentysix January two thousand and seventeenB  Costs and expensessixtytwo  Ms Tseytlina also claimed on behalf of the applicant EUR oneone hundred for the costs and expenses incurred at the domestic level and EUR eight hundred and fifty for the representatives fees incurred before the Court She asked to have the award transferred to the bank account of the AntiDiscrimination Centre Memorial ADC Memorial a nongovernmental organisation in Belgiumsixtythree  The Government made no specific commentsixtyfour  According to the Courts caselaw an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum The Court observes that the legal services agreements concluded for proceedings at the domestic level and before the Court were signed by ADC Memorial and the applicants representative Ms Tseytlina Being one of the de facto beneficiaries of those agreements the applicant did not effect any payment and there is nothing to suggest that he incurred any pecuniary obligation under them Furthermore at least a part of the related expenses arguably incurred by ADC Memorial has not been shown to be related to the applicant and the violations of the Convention against him as found by the Court in the present case Regard being had to the documents in its possession and to its caselaw the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR onezero under all heads to be paid to the AntiDiscrimination Centre Memorial ADC Memorial nongovernmental organisation in BelgiumC  Default interestsixtyfive  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points

       "4  I  JOINDER OF THE APPLICATIONSseventy  Given their common factual and legal background the Court decides that the two applications should be joined pursuant to Rule fortytwo  one of the Rules of CourtII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION DURING PRETRIAL DETENTIONseventyone  The applicant submitted a number of complaints under Article three of the Convention referring to various aspects of his pretrial detention In particular he complained about the conditions of his detention in the remand prisons Next he alleged that he had not received adequate medical assistance while in detention Further he complained about the conditions of his transfer to and from court and the conditions of his detention in the convoy room at the Moscow City Court Article three of the Convention reads as followsNo one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishmentA  Admissibilityseventytwo  The Court notes that these complaints are not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that they are not inadmissible on any other grounds They must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone  Conditions of detention in the remand prisonsseventythree  The applicant alleged that the poor conditions of his detention in all remand prisons including those in the medical wing of IZseventysevenone had been in violation of Article three of the Convention The parties submissions as regards the material conditions of detention have been summarised in paragraphs thirtyfourthirtynine fortysevenfifty and fiftyfivefiftynine aboveseventyfour  The main facts relevant to the assessment of the conditions of detention in particular the size of the cells the number of inmates detained there concurrently with the applicant and the sanitary and hygiene arrangements were not in dispute between the parties Nevertheless they disagreed on whether those conditions had amounted to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article three of the Convention The applicant maintained in particular that four square metres of personal space had been insufficient to avoid overcrowding in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventysevenone Furthermore he complained of inadequate ventilation and lighting of a lack of separation between the lavatory and the living space of limited access to drinking water and about the onehour limit on daily outdoor exercise in all the remand prisons He also contended that the cell in IZseventysevenone was cold The Government on the contrary contended that the applicants conditions of detention had been in conformity with the applicable standards for personal space light room temperature sanitary facilities and hygiene arrangementsseventyfive  The Court recently reiterated the general principles governing the application of Article three of the Convention to conditions of detention as well as the principles concerning prison overcrowding in Muršić v Croatia GC no seven thousand three hundred and thirtyfourthirteen  ninetysixone hundred and fortyone ECHR two thousand and sixteen In particular the Court confirmed that the requirement of three square metres of floor space per detainee in multioccupancy accommodation should be maintained as the relevant minimum standard for its assessment under Article three of the Convention ibid  one hundred and ten and one hundred and fourteen It also stated that a weighty but rebuttable presumption of a violation of Article three arose when personal space available to a detainee fell below three square metres That presumption could be refuted by demonstrating in particular that the cumulative effects of the other aspects of the conditions of detention compensated for the scarce allocation of personal space In that connection the Court takes into account such factors as the length and extent of the restriction the degree of freedom of movement and the adequacy of outofcell activities as well as whether or not the conditions of detention in the particular facility are generally decent ibid  one hundred and twentytwothirtyeightseventysix  In the present case the Court observes that in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventysevenone the applicant was held in cells that allowed him about four square metres of personal space which complies with the required standard On certain occasions in IZseventyseventwo the applicant was afforded personal space of twosix square metres The Court notes that this reduction in the required personal space was not especially long as it lasted from seven to twelve July two thousand and thirteen see for example Kurkowski v Poland no thirtysix thousand two hundred and twentyeightsix  sixtysixsixtyseven nine April two thousand and thirteen In addition the applicant was always provided with an individual bed he has never alleged that the arrangements of the cells such as fixtures like tables beds and toilets impeded him from moving freely within the cell see Vladimir Belyayev v Russia no nine thousand nine hundred and sixtysevensix  thirtyfour seventeen October two thousand and thirteen see also by contrast Manulin v Russia no twentysix thousand six hundred and seventysixsix  fortysix eleven April two thousand and thirteen and Yevgeniy Alekseyenko v Russia no fortyone thousand eight hundred and thirtythreefour  eightyseven twentyseven January two thousand and eleven Furthermore in IZseventyseventwo the applicant spent most of the day outside the cells participating in court hearings as the examination of his criminal case had already started by July two thousand and thirteenseventyseven  As regards other aspects of the physical conditions of detention in all the remand prisons the Court notes that the applicant was allowed a onehour period of outdoor exercise daily in IZ seventysevenfive he had access to a gym upon a written request Also each cell where the applicant was detained in IZseventysevenfive and IZseventyseventwo had unobstructed access to natural light The windows were not fitted with metal shutters or other devices preventing natural light from entering into the cell compare with Babushkin v Russia no sixtyseven thousand two hundred and fiftythreeone  fortyeight eighteen October two thousand and seven Where available a small window pane could be opened for fresh air and the cells provided sufficient artificial light and ventilation The temperature and humidity levels were within the appropriate limits in particular according to the measurement tables for IZseventysevenfive The lavatories in the cells were separated from the living space although the partition did not reach the ceiling contrast with Glotov v Russia no fortyone thousand five hundred and fiftyeightfive  twentyeight ten May two thousand and twelve It must be noted that the time for taking a shower limited to fifteen minutes a week has been considered as manifestly insufficient for maintaining proper bodily hygiene by the Court see Ananyev and Others v Russia nos fortytwo thousand five hundred and twentyfiveseven and sixty thousand eight hundredeight  one hundred and fiftyeight ten January two thousand and twelve with further references However the applicant did not complain about the other practical arrangements for showering such as a limited number of functioning showerheads or a lack of privacy due to the fact that inmates were taken to shower halls in groups ibid Finally the prison authorities regularly carried out the necessary pest control and disinfection measures They also provided detergent products for cleaning the cells on a daily basisseventyeight  Some elements in the applicants account of the conditions in the medical wing of IZseventysevenone were disputed by the Government in particular the allegations of insufficient light and cold in the cell The Court notes that the parties provided different descriptions of the size of the window see paragraphs fortyninefifty above It takes into account the evidential material produced by the Government that cell no seven hundred and seven had one window measuring one hundred and fifteen by one hundred and seventy cm Even though it had a metal grill with twentymm metal bars that arrangement could not significantly reduce the provision of natural light to the cell contrast Vlasov v Russia no seventyeight thousand one hundred and fortysixone  eightytwo twelve June two thousand and eight which was additionally lit with a fluorescent lamp with two fortywatt tubes The Court further notes that the applicant complained about the cell being cold which was also noted by the public commission for the monitoring of detention facilities see paragraph fiftytwo above However according to the certificate issued by the prison governor the temperature in the cell was maintained at eighteenoC which the Court has previously accepted as adequate see Khodorkovskiy v Russia no five thousand eight hundred and twentyninefour  one hundred and eleven thirtyone May two thousand and elevenseventynine  The Court acknowledges that the applicants conditions of detention in all the remand prisons fell short of the Minimum Standard Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners the European Prison Rules and the recommendations of the Committee for the Prevention of Torture in some aspects These include in particular infrequent hot showers restricted outofcell activities and limited access to drinking water The Court also notes in that regard the report issued by the public commission for the monitoring of detention facilities which noted a broken pane of glass the lack of a fridge or television a broken radio socket and dirty scuffed walls in the cell in IZseventysevenone see paragraph fiftytwo above Nevertheless taking into account the cumulative effect of these conditions and the fact that the applicant was only detained in IZseventysevenone for a month and a half the Court does not consider that the conditions of his detention reached the threshold of severity required to characterise the treatment as inhuman or degrading within the meaning of Article three of the Convention see for similar reasoning Yaroslav Belousov cited above  ninetyeight Fetisov and Others v  Russia nos fortythree thousand seven hundred and tenseven and three others  one hundred and thirtyseventhirtyeight seventeen January two thousand and twelve and compare Vladimir Belyayev cited above  thirtysix As regards the reduction in the minimum required personal space in IZseventyseventwo the Court stresses its reasonably short duration the fact that the applicant spent most of the day outside the cell and the general adequacy of the conditions of detention in that facility The Court finds that those factors are capable of rebutting the strong presumption of a violation of Article three of the Conventioneighty  The Court therefore concludes that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention in respect of the conditions of detention in any of the remand prisonstwo  Alleged failure to provide adequate medical assistanceeightyone  The applicant alleged that his eyesight had seriously deteriorated during his detention and that he had not received any treatment for that problem He relied on the medical report of sixteen October two thousand and twelve as proof that his myopia had worsened The Government disagreed with the applicant and argued that he had been regularly examined by medical specialists including ophthalmologists and had been provided with the requisite treatment They pointed out that from seventeen September two thousand and twelve to four November two thousand and twelve the applicant had undergone an inpatient examination in the prison medical wing and that in two thousand and twelve he had had three consultations with an ophthalmologist at a specialist ophthalmology clinic He had also undergone a special examination but it had not led to him being given any disability statuseightytwo  The Court reiterates that even though Article three does not entitle a detainee to be released on compassionate grounds it has always interpreted the requirement to secure the health and wellbeing of detainees among other things as an obligation on the State to provide detainees with the requisite medical assistance see Kudła v Poland GC no thirty thousand two hundred and tenninetysix  ninetyfour ECHR two thousandXI Kalashnikov v Russia no fortyseven thousand and ninetyfiveninetynine  ninetyfive ECHR two thousand and twoVI and Khudobin v Russia no fiftynine thousand six hundred and ninetysixzero  ninetysix ECHR two thousand and sixXII extracts The adequacy of medical assistance remains the most difficult element to determine The Court insists that in particular authorities must ensure that diagnosis and care are prompt and accurate see Khatayev v Russia no fiftysix thousand nine hundred and ninetyfournine  eightyfive eleven October two thousand and eleven Yevgeniy Alekseyenko cited above  one hundred Gladkiy v Russia no three thousand two hundred and fortytwothree  eightyfour twentyone December two thousand and ten Hummatov v Azerbaijan nos nine thousand eight hundred and fiftytwothree and thirteen thousand four hundred and thirteenfour  one hundred and fifteen twentynine November two thousand and seven and mutatis mutandis Holomiov v Moldova no thirty thousand six hundred and fortyninefive  one hundred and twentyone seven November two thousand and six and that where necessitated by the nature of a medical condition supervision is regular and systematic and involves a comprehensive therapeutic strategy aimed at adequately treating the detainees health problems or preventing their aggravation see Hummatov cited above  one hundred and nine and one hundred and fourteen Popov v Russia no twentysix thousand eight hundred and fiftythreefour  two hundred and eleven thirteen July two thousand and six and Sarban v Moldova no three thousand four hundred and fiftysixfive  seventynine four October two thousand and fiveeightythree  On the whole the Court reserves sufficient flexibility in defining the required standard of health care deciding it on a casebycase basis That standard should be compatible with the human dignity of a detainee but should also take into account the practical demands of imprisonment see Aleksanyan v Russia no fortysix thousand four hundred and sixtyeightsix  one hundred and forty twentytwo December two thousand and eighteightyfour  In the present case the applicant argued that no action had been taken by the authorities in spite of his rapidly deteriorating eyesight The Court notes however that the predetention diagnosis of the applicants myopia dated back to two thousand and four eight years prior to his detention see the medical report of sixteen October two thousand and twelve cited in paragraph fiftyone above In the absence of any information about his diagnosis immediately before his arrest it is impossible to establish that the progress of his myopia from medium to high was attributable specifically to the period in detention The Court has examined the applicants medical files submitted by the Government and has found that following his complaints he was given a comprehensive medical examination and was taken to an ophthalmologist on at least three occasions None of the medical reports drawn up after those consultations indicate any threat to the applicants eyesight or the need for further tests or treatment There is nothing in the case file to cast doubt on those reports Furthermore the applicant did not argue that he had not been prescribed or provided with correctional glasses or contact lenses appropriate to his degree of myopia According to the last examination in the remand prison the only recommendation he received was to have regular consultations with an ophthalmologist see paragraph sixtyone above The Court therefore finds no reason to believe that the Russian authorities failed to provide the applicant with adequate medical assistanceeightyfive  In view of the above the Court concludes that there has been no violation of Article three of the Convention in this respectthree  Conditions of transfer to and from courteightysix  The applicant alleged that his transfers from the remand prisons to court and back had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment He complained about the frequency and the length of those transfers of appalling conditions at the prison assembly sections and in the police vans and about the intensity of the schedule which did not leave him sufficient time to sleep The applicant argued that the combination of the above factors had led to physical exhaustion and mental distresseightyseven  The Court examined the conditions of transfer to and from court which were common to the applicant and his codefendants in the case of Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and threeeleven It found that those conditions amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment contrary to Article three of the Convention on account of a lack of sufficient rest and sleep on the days of court hearings overcrowding and generally poor conditions in the prison assembly sections and convoy cells at the Moscow City Court lengthy transfers between the remand prisons and the court and poor conditions during the transfers The Court sees no reason to depart from those findings in the present case Accordingly there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention in that respectIII  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE three OF THE CONVENTION ON ACCOUNT OF CONFINEMENT IN GLASS CABINS AND METAL CAGES DURING COURT HEARINGSeightyeight  The applicant complained that his confinement in glass cabins and metal cages during court hearings had amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment He relied on Article three of the Conventioneightynine  The Government contended that placing defendants behind metal barriers in courtrooms was a technical measure aimed at ensuring the security of all detainees The applicant and his codefendants had been kept in the same if not better conditions while in court as any other detained defendant in criminal proceedingsA  Admissibilityninety  The Government submitted that the applicants complaints about his confinement in glass cabins had been lodged out of time They repeated their submissions made in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and thirteen in that regardninetyone  The Court observes that the Government did not raise the issue of the applicants compliance with the sixmonth rule as regards his confinement in metal cages It has previously found that the application of that rule should not be set aside solely because a Government have not made a preliminary objection based on it see Sabri Güneş v Turkey GC no twentyseven thousand three hundred and ninetysixsix  twentynine twentynine June two thousand and twelve and Walker v the United Kingdom dec no thirtyfour thousand nine hundred and seventynineninetyseven ECHR two thousandI The Court therefore considers it appropriate to address this issue in the present caseninetytwo  The Court reiterates that the applicants confinement in glass cabins and metal cages concerned two distinct periods with materially different conditions of detention which cannot be regarded as a continuous situation for the purposes of calculating the sixmonth timelimit set forth in Article thirtyfive  one of the Convention see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and fourteen Furthermore the Court has previously accepted that no remedy was available to applicants in relation to courtroom arrangements and that the sixmonth timelimit should be calculated from the date the alleged illtreatment ceased see Svinarenko and Slyadnev v Russia GC nos thirtytwo thousand five hundred and fortyoneeight and fortythree thousand four hundred and fortyoneeight  eightyseven ECHR two thousand and fourteen extractsninetythree  Turning to the present case the Court notes that the alleged illtreatment took place during the firstinstance hearing which finished on nineteen December two thousand and thirteen owing to the termination of criminal proceedings against the applicant The Court further notes that the alleged illtreatment by placement in glass cabins began on six June two thousand and thirteen and ended on an unidentified date in the middle of September two thousand and thirteen when the proceedings moved to the Nikulinskiy District Court of Moscow see paragraph sixtythree above The applicant lodged his complaint in that regard on thirty July two thousand and thirteen while he was still being placed in glass cabins The complaint about the confinement in metal cages was not lodged until twentythree March two thousand and fifteen as part of the applicants submissions in reply to the Governments observations on application no fifty thousand and fortyonefourteen that is more than six months after the termination of criminal proceedings against the applicantninetyfour  The applicant has not submitted that there existed any exceptional circumstances preventing him from complying with the six months rule The Court therefore considers that the complaint under Article three of the Convention about being placed in metal cages was lodged out of time and must be rejected in accordance with Article thirtyfive  one and four of the Conventionninetyfive  In contrast the Court finds that the applicant has complied with the six months rule as regards the complaint about being placed in glass cabins It notes that this complaint is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsninetysix  The Court summarised the principles on confinement in glass cabins in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and twentytwentytwo It has examined the conditions of detention in hearing rooms nos three hundred and thirtyeight and six hundred and thirtyfive at the Moscow City Court which were common to the applicant and his codefendants including Mr Belousov ibid  one hundred and twentythreetwentyeight and found a violation in respect of issues identical to those in the present case Having examined all the material submitted to it the Court has not found any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion Accordingly there has been a violation of Article three of the Convention on account of the conditions of detention in hearing room no three hundred and thirtyeight at the Moscow City Court but no violation of Article three as regards the conditions of detention in hearing room no six hundred and thirtyfiveIV  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE five OF THE CONVENTIONninetyseven  The applicant complained under Article five  one of the Convention that his pretrial detention had not been based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence He also complained that his pretrial detention had not been justified by relevant and sufficient reasons as required by Article five  three of the Convention Article five of the Convention in so far as relevant reads as followsone  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law c  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so three  Everyone arrested or detained in accordance with the provisions of paragraph one c of this Article shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorised by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial Release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trialA  Admissibilityninetyeight  As regards the alleged unlawfulness of the applicants detention the Court notes that it was the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow which ordered that measure and that the same court subsequently extended it on several occasions After the case had been sent for trial the detention order was issued by the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court of Moscow The domestic courts acted within their powers in making those decisions and there is nothing to suggest that they were invalid or unlawful under domestic law Accordingly the applicants detention was imposed and extended in accordance with a procedure prescribed by lawninetynine  As regards the allegation that the applicants detention was not based on a reasonable suspicion that he had committed criminal offences his complaint under Article five  one of the Convention overlaps to a large extent with his complaint under Article five  three about the authorities failure to adduce relevant and sufficient reasons justifying the extensions of his detention pending criminal proceedings The Court reiterates that while Article five  one c of the Convention is mostly concerned with the existence of a lawful basis for detention within criminal proceedings Article five  three of the Convention deals with the possible justification for such detention Moreover according to the Courts established caselaw under the latter provision the persistence of a reasonable suspicion is a sine qua non for the validity of continued detention see Buzadji v the Republic of Moldova GC no twentythree thousand seven hundred and fiftyfiveseven  eightyseven ECHR two thousand and sixteen extracts The Court therefore deems it more appropriate to deal with this complaint under Article five  three of the Convention see Kovyazin and Others v Russia nos thirteen thousand and eightthirteen and two others  seventyone seventeen September two thousand and fifteen Taranenko v Russia no nineteen thousand five hundred and fiftyfourfive  fortysix fifteen May two thousand and fourteen and Khodorkovskiy cited above  one hundred and sixtyfiveone hundred  Furthermore the Court finds that the applicants complaint of a violation of Article five  three is not manifestly illfounded within the meaning of Article thirtyfive  three a of the Convention It further notes that this part of the application is not inadmissible on any other grounds It must therefore be declared admissibleB  Meritsone hundred and one  The parties made essentially the same submissions under Article five of the Convention as in Kovyazin and Others cited above  seventythreeseventyfour The relevant general principles applicable in this case were summarised by the Court in that judgment ibid  seventyfiveseventyeightone hundred and two  The period of detention to be taken into consideration in this case started on ten June two thousand and twelve the date of the applicants arrest and ended on nineteen December two thousand and thirteen when he was released following the application of the Amnesty Act Accordingly the period to be taken into consideration is one year and six months The Court also notes that the criminal trial in the applicants case began on eighteen June two thousand and thirteen which is one year after his arrest Having regard to the considerable length of detention in the light of the presumption in favour of release the Court finds that the Russian authorities were required to put forward very weighty reasons for maintaining that measure against the applicantone hundred and three  It follows from the applicants detention orders and the Governments observations that the primary reason for his continuous detention was the gravity of the charges Firstly the domestic courts considered that the applicant faced with the risk of prison was likely to abscond influence witnesses or interfere with the administration of justice Secondly they seemed to suggest that the very nature of the offences in question together with information about the applicants character made it likely that he would reoffend and obstruct the course of the criminal proceedingsone hundred and four  The Court has previously examined similar complaints lodged by the applicants codefendants and found a violation of their rights set out in Article five  three of the Convention see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and thirtythreethirtyeight and Kovyazin and Others cited above  eightytwoninetyfour The Court noted in particular the domestic courts reliance on the gravity of the charges as the main factor for the assessment of the potential to abscond reoffend or obstruct the course of justice and their reluctance to pay proper attention to a discussion of each applicants personal situation or to have proper regard to factors pointing in favour of release It also noted the use of collective detention orders without a casebycase assessment of the grounds for detention in respect of each codefendant and the failure to thoroughly examine the possibility of applying a less rigid measure of restraint such as bailone hundred and five  Having regard to the material in its possession the Court notes that the Government have not put forward any fact or argument capable of persuading it to reach a different conclusion in the present case Indeed the specific offence imputed to the applicant  shouting political slogans and throwing a flagpole which hit a police officer but caused no lasting harm  may have initially warranted his pretrial detention However with the passage of time the nature and the seriousness of the offence as grounds for the applicants continued detention inevitably became less and less relevant see Kovyazin and Others cited above  eightyfive and Artemov v Russia no fourteen thousand nine hundred and fortyfivethree  seventyfive three April two thousand and fourteen The Court further notes that the applicants detention was extended by the same collective orders as those of his codefendants without any individual assessment of his situation Kovyazin and Others cited above  ninetytwoninetythree In addition the domestic courts dismissed the applicants requests for an alternative preventive measure without even considering the guarantees signed by parliamentary deputies a wellknown writer and the directors of prominent NGOs agreeing to vouch for him see paragraphs fifteensixteen eighteen and twentyone aboveone hundred and six  There has accordingly been a violation of Article five  three of the ConventionV  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLES ten AND eleven OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and seven  The applicant alleged a violation of his right to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly He complained in particular of disruptive security measures at the site of the meeting at Bolotnaya Square and argued that his pretrial detention and prosecution for participation in acts of mass disorder had not been necessary in a democratic society He relied on Articles ten and eleven of the Convention which read as followsArticle tenone  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting television or cinema enterprisestwo  The exercise of these freedoms since it carries with it duties and responsibilities may be subject to such formalities conditions restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security territorial integrity or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals for the protection of the reputation or rights of others for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciaryArticle elevenone  Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association with others including the right to form and to join trade unions for the protection of his intereststwo  No restrictions shall be placed on the exercise of these rights other than such as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety for the prevention of disorder or crime for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others This Article shall not prevent the imposition of lawful restrictions on the exercise of these rights by members of the armed forces of the police or of the administration of the Stateone hundred and eight  The Governments submissions on the admissibility and the merits of the case were identical to those in Yaroslav Belousov cited above  fifteen thousand six hundred and fiftyseven and one hundred and sixtysixtythreeone hundred and nine  The applicant submitted that on six May two thousand and twelve he went to take part in a peaceful meeting which had been authorised by the Moscow authorities He alleged that the episodes of disorderly behaviour and the clashes between the protesters and the police had been caused or compounded by the authorities crowdcontrol measures The applicant insisted that he was a peaceful lawabiding individual who had not planned to take part in acts of mass disorder He had never pleaded guilty to the offence he had been charged with and had only agreed to terminate the criminal proceedings against him following the Amnesty Act because his eyesight had been deteriorating In the applicants view his ensuing prosecution and the severity of the charges against him had had the aim of discouraging him other opposition supporters and the public at large from attending demonstrationsone hundred and ten  The Court notes that while the criminal proceedings in question were still pending at the time when the applicant lodged the first application they were subsequently terminated following the Amnesty Act It reiterates in this connection that a decision or measure favourable to an applicant is not in principle sufficient to deprive him of his status as a victim unless the national authorities have acknowledged either expressly or in substance and then afforded redress for the breach of the Convention see Öztürk v Turkey GC no twentytwo thousand four hundred and seventynineninetythree  seventythree ECHR one thousand nine hundred and ninetynineVI In the instant case the applicant was not entitled under the domestic law to compensation for damages or the restitution of various rights for the measures against him see paragraph sixtynine above Nor did the Zamoskvoretskiy District Court in its decision of nineteen December two thousand and thirteen acknowledge the alleged breach of the applicants right to freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly owing to those measures see paragraph thirtytwo above The applicant may not therefore be considered to have lost his victim status on account of the termination of the criminal proceedings against him following the application of the Amnesty Act see mutatis mutandis Gülcü v Turkey no seventeen thousand five hundred and twentysixten  ninetynineone hundred nineteen January two thousand and sixteenone hundred and eleven  On the other hand regard being had to the essence of the applicants complaints the Court will examine whether despite the termination of the criminal proceedings he could still demonstrate that his pretrial detention and prosecution for a criminal offence amounted to an interference with the exercise of his rights to freedom of expression and to freedom of peaceful assembly It notes that criminal proceedings not culminating in a criminal conviction may depending on the circumstances amount to an interference with those rights see Döner and Others v Turkey no twentynine thousand nine hundred and ninetyfourtwo  eightynine seven March two thousand and seventeenone hundred and twelve  The Court observes that the applicant was not convicted of the criminal offence of mass disorder unlike those of his codefendants who were ineligible to be amnestied see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  one hundred and seventyseven Therefore the detrimental consequences of his prosecution as presented by the applicant were limited to those which were connected with his pretrial detention The Court has found above that his detention for one year and six months was not justified under Article five  three of the Convention see paragraphs one hundred and twoone hundred and six above and that that preventive measure was associated with prison transfers and courtroom arrangements which constituted treatment contrary to Article three see paragraphs eightyseven and ninetysix aboveone hundred and thirteen  In examining whether the same facts also gave rise to an interference with the applicants rights under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention the Court notes the applicants allegation that the excessively long pretrial detention and the severity of the charges were intended to discourage him and other opposition supporters from attending demonstrations and participating in political debate However unlike in the case of the applicants convicted codefendant Mr Belousov the Court does not find sufficient grounds to accept that allegation Mr Belousov was charged under Article two hundred and twelve of the Criminal Code of mass disorder which consisted of staying at the site of the rally and chanting antigovernment slogans in addition to a separate charge of violent acts against police officers under Article three hundred and eighteen of the Criminal Code In that case the Court found that acts which were peaceful had accounted for a striking oneandahalfyear addition to the applicants prison term see Yaroslav Belousov cited above  seventeen thousand seven hundred and seventyeightone hundred and fourteen  In the present case by contrast the charges of mass disorder under Article two hundred and twelve of the Criminal Code covered both the peaceful and violent acts imputed to the applicant namely chanting antigovernment slogans and throwing a flagpole at the police The judicial proceedings did not establish whether the applicant had indeed committed those acts because his prosecution was terminated before the end of the trial The essential details relating to his conduct at the site of the rally remained unclear and no assessment was given of the degree of violence in the impugned acts or the possible role of the applicant in the initial acts of aggression which led to the disruption of the public event Consequently the applicant has not demonstrated that the crowdcontrol measures complained of or the ensuing criminal charges related to the exercise of the right to peaceful assembly or to the political message expressed thereby Accordingly there are no grounds to conclude that the measures constituted an interference with the rights to freedom of expression or to freedom of peaceful assemblyone hundred and fifteen  It follows that the complaints under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention must be rejected as manifestly illfounded pursuant to Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionVI  ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE eighteen OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and sixteen  The applicant complained under Article eighteen of the Convention that the criminal proceedings against him had pursued the aim of undermining his right to freedom of assembly The Court considers that this complaint falls to be examined under Article eighteen in conjunction with Article eleven of the Convention Article eighteen of the Convention reads as followsThe restrictions permitted under the Convention to the said rights and freedoms shall not be applied for any purpose other than those for which they have been prescribedone hundred and seventeen  In their submissions under this head the parties reiterated their arguments as regards the alleged interference with the right to freedom of assemblyone hundred and eighteen  The Court notes that this complaint is linked to the complaints examined above under Articles ten and eleven of the Convention Having regard to its findings in paragraphs one hundred and tenone hundred and fifteen the Court considers that that this part of the application is also manifestly illfounded and must be rejected pursuant to Article thirtyfive  three a and four of the ConventionVII  APPLICATION OF ARTICLE fortyone OF THE CONVENTIONone hundred and nineteen  Article fortyone of the Convention providesIf the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made the Court shall if necessary afford just satisfaction to the injured partyA  Damageone hundred and twenty  The applicant claimed oneone hundredzero euros EUR in respect of nonpecuniary damageone hundred and twentyone  The Government contested the claim as unreasonable and excessiveone hundred and twentytwo  The Court observes that it has found violations of Articles three and five of the Convention in respect of the applicant In those circumstances the Court considers that the applicants suffering and frustration cannot be compensated for by a mere finding of a violation Making its assessment on an equitable basis it awards the applicant EUR tenzero in respect of nonpecuniary damageB  Costs and expensesone hundred and twentythree  The applicant did not submit any claims under this head Accordingly there is no call to award him any sum on that accountC  Default interestone hundred and twentyfour  The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank to which should be added three percentage points   \n",
